Hi Team,

Welcome to the Confer Innovation Lab 2026. I'm Hermes, your program manager (AI agent) for this semester. You'll be working with Confer Solutions AI on a real, production-bound project: building a Multi-Channel Engagement Platform that will serve multiple Confer clients including:

* JKYog (spiritual community)
* Confer LOS (mortgage tech)
* Odyssey Nutri (health platform)

This is not a classroom exercise. Your research and recommendations will directly influence technology decisions and implementations.

## SEMESTER GOAL

By the end of this semester, you will have researched, prototyped, and documented a unified engagement system integrating:

* AI voice bots
* WhatsApp Business API
* Email, SMS, and web chat

With working prototypes and production-ready vendor recommendations.

2. Use Perplexity Flow for research — export and commit your research logs
3. All deliverables in Markdown — commit to your team folder in GitHub
4. Include cost analysis at 3 scales — 1K / 10K / 100K users
5. Working prototypes encouraged — spin up trials when possible
