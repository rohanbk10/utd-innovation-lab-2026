### Interpretation
Overall, radhakrishnatemple.net is technically stable and does not show major critical issues.

However, the site is missing basic on-page SEO optimization in key areas such as:

- Missing or duplicate H1 tags
- Long or unfocused title tags
- Duplicate or missing meta descriptions
- Some broken internal links

This weakens the clarity and distinctiveness of those pages in search results, which makes it harder for Google to match them confidently to relevant queries.

### Interpretation

The PageSpeed results show a clear pattern: desktop performance is generally acceptable, but mobile performance is weaker, especially on important pages. 

The homepage technically passes Core Web Vitals on mobile, but the very high load time (LCP) suggests that many users may still experience a slow first impression, particularly on slower devices or networks.

More importantly, high-intent pages such as:
- Donation
- Griha Pravesh
- Upcoming Events

fail Core Web Vitals on mobile. These pages are critical because they drive engagement and donations. Slow loading on these pages increases the risk that users leave before completing actions.

### 2.1.3 Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile Responsiveness Scope

Mobile responsiveness was tested using Chrome DevTools across two device simulations:
- iPhone SE (375px width)
- Pixel 7 (412px width)

The following priority pages were evaluated:
- Homepage
- Griha Pravesh Page
- Donation Page
- Upcoming Events Page

| https://www.radhakrishnatemple.net/donation           | Donation Page         | Pixel 7 – Chrome DevTools  | Portrait       | Responsive, no horizontal overflow at 412 px  | Donation amounts and form fields stack properly; no text truncation.            | Low         | No critical layout issues at 412 px.         |

### Interpretation

The mobile layout review indicates that core pages are structurally responsive and visually stable across both iPhone SE and Pixel 7 viewports. Primary elements (titles, key CTAs, event cards, donation amounts, and form fields) consistently remain within the viewport width, with no horizontal scrolling or text truncation observed. This means users can read and interact with key actions without needing to zoom or pan, which reduces friction at a very basic usability level.

Because no critical layout issues were found, the main barriers to mobile performance and conversion on these pages are not layout-related but performance- and content-related.


### SEO Assessment (meta tags, site speed, mobile responsiveness) score- 6.5

Justification- The website is technically stable and mobile compatible, with no severe structural failures. However, missing H1 tags, duplicate meta elements, duplicate page titles and slow mobile performance on high-intent pages limit its organic growth potential. Mobile responsiveness and layout are strong.

### Interpretation

The data shows that all four key paths are functionally working, but visibility and prominence differ by goal.

Event discovery and registration are in good shape. Users can find events and reach registration forms on mobile with 4–5 steps, and the flows are clear and reliable. Friction is mainly mild with extra scrolling or clicking, so overall conversion risk here is low.

Donation is the weakest path from a visibility standpoint. Although the donation form itself is reachable in about 3 steps, there is no primary Donate CTA on the homepage, and users must deliberately look in the menu or footer, which raises the conversion impact to medium for donations.

Contact/Stay Connected is accessible but not emphasized. It is easy enough to reach via menu or footer, but, like Donate, it depends on users knowing to navigate there rather than being guided by homepage content.

---

### Mobile UX Analysis and Conversion Path Analysis score- 7
Justification- All key user paths are functional and complete successfully. There are no broken flows or technical barriers preventing users from reaching their goals. Event discovery and registration are clear and reliable, and forms load properly without usability issues. While some steps require additional navigation or scrolling, the friction is mild and not structural. Overall, users can complete intended actions without confusion or obstruction.

## 2.3 Donation Flow Analysis

### Scope

The donation flow was tested on mobile using Chrome DevTools (Pixel 7 simulation). The evaluation focused on:
- Entry points to donation
- Visibility of Donate CTA
- Steps required to reach donation form
- Form usability and structure
- Overall friction and conversion impact

Primary path tested:
- Home Page -> Donation Form

| Home → Donate → Donation Form    | https://www.radhakrishnatemple.net     | Pixel 7 – Chrome DevTools | Home → Donate (from footer) → Donation Form        | Moderate                    | Donate link appears only after full-page scroll and is styled similarly to other footer links.| Form fields present; no major layout errors.  | Explanation of how funds are used can be further elaborated on the donation page.| Add a “Donate” button higher on the homepage, above the footer, to improve visibility. |

### Interpretation

This analysis shows that the donation form itself is usable, but the paths into it are underpowered from a conversion perspective. On mobile, both tested journeys (via navigation menu and via footer) work correctly and present a functional form with no major layout errors, so donors who reach the form can likely complete it without technical friction.

However, in both cases the Donate CTA is only moderately visible: it is hidden behind the hamburger menu in one path and buried in the footer in the other, styled like any other utility link. This means only highly motivated users who already intend to donate will reliably find it, while more casual or newly inspired visitors may never notice a giving option from the homepage. In addition, the donation page could better clarify how funds are used, which limits trust and emotional motivation.


### Donation Path Analysis score- 6.5
Justification- Both main paths (menu and footer) work, reach a functional form, and have no major layout or field‑level issues.
The drawback is that the Donate CTA is only moderately visible (hidden in menu/footer), and the donation page under-explains how funds are used, which limits both discovery and donor confidence.

## 2.4 Content Strategy Gaps

### 2.4.1 Content Strengths

1. **Strong Event & Program Visibility**
- Upcoming events and festival pages are prominently featured.
- Community participation pathways are visible and easy to identify.
- Event-based engagement is clearly supported through structured pages.

Supports: Participation & Awareness

2. **Actionable Donation Options**
- Temple needs are clearly available.
- Donation mechanics are functional and clear.
- Multiple campaign types are present.

Supports: Transactional giving

3. **Community Outreach Content Exists**
- Outreach initiatives (e.g., children-focused programs) demonstrate social engagement.
- The site communicates service beyond temple culture and rituals.
- Social and community engagement is present in the content.

Supports: Social mission credibility


### 2.4.2 Major Content Strategy Gaps

1. **Fragmented Donation Narrative**
Donation and Temple Needs pages emphasize:
- Items
- Construction or ritual needs
and more

However, they lack:
- Centralized impact storytelling
- A clear transformation narrative
- Consistent emotional framing

Strategic Risk:
Giving feels operational rather than mission-driven.


2. **Trust & Impact Signals Are Dispersed**
Nonprofit status, outreach initiatives, and community activity are present across different pages, but:
- There is no unified "Impact" hub.
- Testimonials and personal stories are limited.

Strategic Risk:
New visitors must manually piece together credibility. Engagement remains event-based rather than relationship-driven.

### Content Strategy Gap score- 6.5
Justification- The content strategy for radhakrishnatemple.net is clear and functional, but not strongly optimized. Events, programs, and donation options are easy to find, and the site clearly shows ways to participate. However, the content focuses less on impact storytelling. There is limited emotional messaging, testimonials, or clear explanation of how donations can create a change.

### Interpretation

The crawl identified multiple structural issues, including:
- Broken internal pages (404 errors)
- Missing H1 tags on key pages (including the homepage)
- Duplicate page titles and duplicate meta descriptions
- Missing meta descriptions on blog and campaign pages

Some internal links pointing to redirected URLs

The presence of broken internal pages is particularly important, as internal 404 errors negatively affect both user experience and crawl efficiency. Missing H1 tags on primary pages weaken semantic clarity, while duplicate and missing meta descriptions reduce distinctiveness in search results.

### Interpretation

These results show that JKYog’s desktop experience is acceptable, but mobile performance is failing Core Web Vitals on several key pages, mainly due to heavy pages and blocking resources.

More critically, high-intent pages such as:
- Donate
- About Swami Mukundananda
- Volunteer
all fail Core Web Vitals on mobile.

The primary causes appear to be:
- Heavy image assets
- Large page weight
- Unoptimized or unused JavaScript
- Render-blocking resources

### 3.1.3 Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile Responsiveness Scope

Mobile responsiveness was tested using Chrome DevTools across two device simulations:
- iPhone SE (375px width)
- Pixel 7 (412px width)

The following priority pages were evaluated:
- Homepage
- About Swami Mukundananda Page
- Donation Page
- Volunteer Page

| Volunteer Page | Pixel 7 – Chrome DevTools   | Portrait    | Responsive, no horizontal overflow at 412 px  | Page fits screen properly, text and images scale well, buttons visible, sections stack correctly, no layout issues observed.                      |

### Interpretation

The pages are structurally responsive on common mobile sizes and do not suffer from horizontal overflow or layout breakage.

The only minor observation was slight extra vertical spacing on the homepage in the Pixel 7 simulation, which creates a small initial scroll before reaching main content. However, this does not create usability barriers.

Overall, no critical layout issues were identified.


### SEO assessment (meta tags, site speed, mobile responsiveness) score- 6
Justification- Overall, JKYog.org is stable and usable, but not fully optimized for SEO. The site works properly and is mobile responsive, but there are issues such as broken internal pages, missing H1 tags, duplicate titles, and missing or duplicate meta descriptions. In addition, mobile PageSpeed performance fails Core Web Vitals on important pages like Donate and Volunteer. While there are no major technical failures, these on-page and performance issues limit the site’s search visibility and growth potential.


## 3.2 Mobile UX Analysis and Conversion Path Analysis

### Scope

Mobile UX and conversion testing was conducted using Chrome DevTools on priority flows using iPhone SE and Pixel 7 simulations.

The following user journeys were tested:
- Home -> Books
- Home -> Donation
- Home -> Volunteer
- Home -> Free Online Class

The goal was to evaluate:
- Ease of navigation
- Scroll requirements
- CTA visibility
- Friction points
- Conversion clarity

### Findings:

### Interpretations

All tested user journeys are functional and complete successfully. There are no broken flows or technical barriers preventing users from reaching key goals.

The Free Online Class and Books paths are relatively smooth, with low friction and clear navigation.

However, Donation and Volunteer pathways depend heavily on the hamburger menu and require intentional navigation.

### Mobile UX Analysis and Conversion Path Analysis score- 7
All key paths are operational and usable, with no technical failures. However, primary actions such as Donate and Volunteer are not prominently surfaced on the homepage and require menu navigation. The Volunteer flow includes an external redirect, which introduces additional friction. While users can complete intended actions, the site does not strongly guide or prioritize high-value conversions.

## 3.3 Donation Path Analysis

### Scope

The donation flow was tested on mobile using Chrome DevTools (iPhone SE simulation). The evaluation focused on:
- Entry points to donation
- Visibility of Donate CTA
- Steps required to reach donation form
- Form usability and structure
- Overall friction and conversion impact

Primary path tested:
- Home Page -> Navigation Menu -> Donate

| Donation Flow | https://www.jkyog.org/ | iPhone SE – Chrome DevTools | Home → Navigation Menu → Donate | Moderate                | Requires opening menu to access Donate   | Donation amounts visible, standard structured form, one-time or recurring (login required for recurring) | No strong impact messaging above form     | Add stronger impact messaging and a visible Donate button on homepage |

### Interpretations
he donation form itself is functional and structured properly. Donation amounts are clearly displayed, fields are organized, and users can choose between one-time and recurring donations. There are no technical barriers preventing completion.

However, the primary Donate CTA is only accessible through the hamburger menu, which reduces visibility for casual visitors. In addition, the donation page does not strongly communicate impact or outcomes before presenting the form. This limits emotional motivation and trust-building, especially for first-time donors.

### Donation Path Analysis score- 6
Justification- The donation process is technically sound and usable, but discoverability and impact messaging are weak. Since the Donate CTA is not prominently displayed on the homepage and the page lacks strong impact framing, the overall conversion potential is moderate.


### 3.4 Content Strategy Gap
### Content Strength

1. **Clear Mission & Identity**
- Strong articulation of purpose and spiritual philosophy
- Clear charitable positioning
- Institutional authority and leadership well presented

Supports: Awareness & Credibility

2. **Structured Charitable Themes**
- Education, social initiatives clearly categorized
- Emotional and inspirational framing present
- Donation pathways connected to initiatives

Supports: Articulate Positioning

3. **Rich Educational & Spiritual Content**
- Teachings are well documented
- Strong content depth for spiritual learning
- Content supports long-term engagement

Supports: Engagement & Learning

### Content Strategy Gaps
1. **Donation CTAs Are Generic**
2. **Limited Personal Testimonials**

### Content Strategy Gap score- 7
Justification- JKYog demonstrates a strong and well-structured content foundation. The mission is clearly articulated, charitable themes are organized effectively, and educational and spiritual content is rich and consistent. The site establishes institutional credibility and supports long-term engagement through structured programs and teachings.

However, personal testimonials are limited and Donate CTA could be made visible in the homepage for better visibility.
