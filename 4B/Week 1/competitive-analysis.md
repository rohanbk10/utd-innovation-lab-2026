# Task 2: Competitive Intelligence (JKYog / Radhakrishna Temple Dallas)

[](https://github.com/confersolutions/utd-innovation-lab-2026/blob/main/4B/README.md#task-2-competitive-intelligence)
Required competitors:
Dallas Hanuman ([https://www.dallashanuman.org](https://www.dallashanuman.org/)) — detailed breakdown
1 Local spiritual/temple organization — your choice
1 National/global spiritual org with strong digital presence — your choice
Find 1 NEW competitor they should be tracking — discover through research
Deliverable: competitive-analysis.md
Include for each:
Channels used (website, WhatsApp status, SMS, email, app, social media, events)
Content strategy analysis
User engagement tactics
Technology stack (if detectable)
Strengths and weaknesses vs JKYog

Let's identify the 4 competitors to analyze. The first one is already given (Dallas Hanuman). I'm inclined to pick the second one as Isckon - Kalachandji temple, Dallas. Does that work? What about the third and fourth, help me identify those as well.

Yes, ISKCON Dallas – Radha Kalachandji Temple is an excellent choice for your second (local) competitor, and it fits very cleanly into the “local spiritual/temple organization” slot.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3]

## Recommended set of 4 competitors

Here’s a clean set that covers your assignment requirements and gives you good diversity for digital strategy comparisons:

1. **Dallas Hanuman Temple**
    - Category: Local spiritual/temple org (given in prompt).
    - Rationale: Strong local bhakti base, events-driven presence, Indian diaspora focus; good contrast with JKYog’s programmatic/education-heavy model.[^1_4]
2. **ISKCON Dallas – Radha Kalachandji Temple**
    - Category: Local spiritual/temple org (your choice).
    - Why it works:
        - Very recognizable brand (Hare Krishna) with a distinct lifestyle/culture (prasadam restaurant, gurukul, kirtan, etc.).[^1_5][^1_1]
        - Active digital channels: website, YouTube channel, and Facebook presence you can benchmark (streaming kirtans, lectures, festivals).[^1_2][^1_3][^1_1]
    - This is a solid “yes” for your Task 2 list.
3. **DFW Hindu Temple – Youth Group / VV Temple** (as your second “local” lens)
    - Category: Local spiritual/temple org, but with strong youth/community angle.
    - Why it’s a good pick vs JKYog:
        - Explicitly organized **youth group** with ~120 members, leadership roles (President, VP, etc.), and structured volunteering. That maps closely to JKYog’s SPARK, KAKE, Bal-Mukund, and youth club initiatives.[^1_6][^1_7]
        - Lets you directly compare youth engagement, leadership pipelines, and how each org uses digital tools (site, email, maybe WhatsApp/Discord) to organize service and events.
    - This gives you a “local + youth-centric” comparator that’s very relevant to JKYog’s positioning.
4. **ISKCON global digital ecosystem** as the **national/global org with strong digital presence**
    - Category: National/global spiritual org (strong digital).
    - Why it fits:
        - ISKCON as a movement has extensive online reach: live-streamed aratis and kirtans, global YouTube channels, podcasts, apps, online courses, and centralized content portals.[^1_8][^1_3]
        - Strategically, JKYog is also global and content-driven (courses, lectures, youth programs), so comparing JKYog vs “global ISKCON digital” will be rich for:
            - Content formats (shorts vs long pravachans vs courses).
            - Platform mix (YouTube, Facebook, apps, OTT-style archives).
            - Funnel from digital content → retreats, donations, and membership.

## Slot that remains “NEW competitor they should track”

For the “1 NEW competitor they should be tracking,” you can frame **global ISKCON digital** as the “big, structured global benchmark,” but I’d actually suggest using that “NEW” tag for a digital-first spiritual brand such as **Go Spiritual India** (if you’re allowed to go India-based):

- It is explicitly positioning itself at the intersection of spirituality and digital/tech (news magazine portal \& app, content hub, etc.).[^1_9]
- That gives JKYog a look at a “spiritual media platform” model rather than just “temple + events.”

**One workable mapping for your deliverable:**

- Competitor 1 (local temple): Dallas Hanuman Temple
- Competitor 2 (local temple – your choice): ISKCON Dallas – Radha Kalachandji Temple
- Competitor 3 (national/global digital): ISKCON Global Digital (Hare Krishna movement online)
- Competitor 4 (NEW \& digital‑first): Go Spiritual India (or a similar digital‑native spiritual content platform)

If you’d like, next we can lock this mapping to your professor’s wording, then I can outline the exact sections you should create inside `competitive-analysis.md` for each of the four (channels, content strategy, engagement tactics, tech stack, strengths/weaknesses vs JKYog).

# Karya Siddhi Hanuman Temple

Radha Kalachandji Temple Isckon
BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham
Isha Institute of Inner Sciences

these are the final four I've picked. Now help me evaluate them. I will ask you a question and you will help me find the answer one by one, okay?

Yes, this set of four is very workable, and going one‑by‑one is a good approach.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4][^3_5]

To confirm, we’ll analyze:

1. **Karya Siddhi Hanuman Temple** (Frisco, TX)[^3_6][^3_7][^3_4]
2. **Radha Kalachandji Temple (ISKCON Dallas)**[^3_8][^3_9][^3_5]
3. **BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham, Robbinsville**[^3_10][^3_1]
4. **Isha Institute of Inner-sciences, Tennessee**[^3_2][^3_3]

Each time you ask a question (e.g., “What channels do they use?”, “What’s their content strategy?”), tell me which of the four you want to focus on, and I’ll answer specifically for that organization.
