**User**

find the excel files, rkt_audit and jkyog_audit

---

**Cursor**

I’ll search your `c:\Users\rohan\Downloads` workspace for Excel files named (or starting with) `rkt_audit` and `jkyog_audit`, including `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.xlsm`.

No exact matches in `c:\Users\rohan\Downloads`. I’m going to broaden the filename search (e.g., different ordering like `audit_rkt`, extra spaces, etc.) and check for any Excel files containing `rkt`/`jkyog` + `audit` in the name.

I searched all subfolders under `c:\Users\rohan\Downloads` and found **no Excel files at all** (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`), and therefore **no** `rkt_audit` or `jkyog_audit`.

If those files exist on your PC, they’re likely **not in Downloads** (common places: `Desktop`, `Documents`, `OneDrive\Documents`, `OneDrive\Desktop`). If you tell me the folder to search (or move/copy them into `Downloads`), I can locate them immediately.

what is the target audience with jkyog

---

**Cursor**

I’ll quickly search your workspace for `jkyog` to see what it refers to (a company, project, dataset, etc.), then I can answer who the intended/target audience is.

---

**User**

search online for information about jkyog

---

**Cursor**

I’ll look up `JKYog` online (including what it stands for, what the organization does, and who it serves), then I’ll summarize the most reliable sources.

`JKYog` most commonly refers to **Jagadguru Kripalu Yog (also called Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog)**, a **spiritual and charitable nonprofit** founded by **Swami Mukundananda** (US org founded 2009; India trust established 2008). It focuses on **Vedic spirituality / Bhakti yoga**, along with **yoga, meditation, mind management**, and runs **community/charitable** efforts (e.g., education and healthcare initiatives).

- **What it is (overview)**: see Wikipedia’s summary of the organization’s mission/activities: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JKYog`
- **Official “About” (India trust)**: describes aims and projects: `https://jkyog.in/en/about/jkyog-india/`
- **Official online programs/events hub (US site)**: lists online sessions and programs: `https://www.jkyog.org/online_events`

If you mean a *different* “jkyog” (e.g., a company acronym inside your audit files), tell me the context (where you saw the term), and I’ll narrow it down.

## Target audience of JKYog

Based on JKYog’s stated mission and programs, the target audience is mainly:

- **Spiritual seekers** interested in **Vedic/Hindu spirituality**, especially **Bhakti yoga**, meditation, and scriptural study (Bhagavad Gita, etc.), including people wanting mind-management and “life transformation” teachings.
- **General wellness participants** looking for **yoga, breathing practices, relaxation, meditation**, and holistic well-being programs.
- **Families, children, and youth**, via structured programs like **Bal-Mukund** (children) and **youth/leadership** initiatives.
- **Community members and beneficiaries of charity work**, especially **underprivileged groups** supported through education/healthcare projects (not the “spiritual program audience,” but part of who they serve).

**User**

do a deep research and find all the information you can to find out about the target audience. what their channels are and their communications

---

**Cursor**

I’ll do an online deep-dive across JKYog’s official sites plus their major public channels (social, email/newsletter, events/centers) to map **who they target**, **how they reach them**, and **what communication formats they use**.

Good—there are dedicated official pages for **social media**, **newsletter**, and multiple program lines (Bal-Mukund, Youth Club, retreats/LTP). Next I’ll fetch those key pages to extract specific channel list, signup/contact mechanisms, and the audience positioning language they use.

Now I have solid primary-source text on their **program segmentation** (kids/teens/college+young pros/adults) and several explicit **communication channels** (WhatsApp broadcasts/groups, email newsletter, websites/classes, Zoom-based events, in-person centers). Next I’ll enumerate their public social platforms and communication formats by pulling their official social links and channel pages.

Social content buckets
Automation triggers and workflows

generate content for the above for jkyog for a .mb file, considering the information below:

- the whatsapp registration button is at the bottom of the website, and in general does not seem like a good funnel strategy. evident from the fact that the first link is instagram and has 614k followers and whatsapp have 1.4k.

- for email cadence, based on the target audience, generate some good tips.

- based on the channels, create parameters for the types of contents, some good limits. do some research for good practices and tips on this.

I’ll pull a few up-to-date best-practice references (WhatsApp opt-in/broadcast, nonprofit email cadence, social content systems, and automation workflows), then I’ll generate a ready-to-save `.mb`-style markdown document tailored to JKYog and your funnel observations.

```markdown
## JKYog Growth Ops Playbook (WhatsApp + Email + Social + Automation)

### Context + constraints (from current channel signals)
- **Instagram is the primary discovery channel** (e.g., `@jkyog.india` ~614k followers).
- **WhatsApp is under-leveraged as a funnel** (~1.4k) and the **opt-in CTA placement (bottom of site)** is weak for conversion.
- Strategy implication: treat **IG/YouTube/Events as TOFU**, and build **intent-based WhatsApp + Email lists** as MOFU/retention (with strict opt-in + segmentation).

---

## WhatsApp broadcast strategy

### Goals (what WhatsApp should do for JKYog)
- **Retention**: keep seekers consistent with sadhana/classes.
- **Attendance lift**: reminders for live classes, retreats/LTP, temple programs.
- **Conversion**: move “social followers → registered attendee → repeat attendee → volunteer/donor/member.”
- **Trust**: deliver value-first messages to avoid blocks/reports.

### List architecture (separate broadcasts by intent)
Create *distinct opt-in lists* (don’t mix, don’t “blast all”):
1. **Daily Inspiration (Swamiji)**  
   - **Audience**: adults/seekers who explicitly want daily content.  
   - **Frequency**: daily (value-only; minimal links).
2. **Online Class Reminders**  
   - **Audience**: people who registered for online classes.  
   - **Frequency**: per class schedule; cap reminders to **max 2 touches/class session** (e.g., “tomorrow” + “starting now”).
3. **Events (Retreat/LTP/Festivals)**  
   - **Audience**: people who opted into event updates for their region/center.  
   - **Frequency**: **1–2/week**, plus time-critical updates.
4. **Parents (Bal Mukund / kids programs)**  
   - **Audience**: parents/guardians.  
   - **Frequency**: **1/week** schedule + urgent changes only.
5. **Youth (13+) + YUVA (18–30)**  
   - **Audience**: teens/young adults (and parents if needed).  
   - **Frequency**: **1–2/week** (opportunities, reminders, highlights).
6. **Donors/Seva Updates**  
   - **Audience**: donors/volunteers.  
   - **Frequency**: **2–4/month** (impact + campaigns; no spam).

**Rule**: if someone didn’t opt into a category, they don’t get those messages.

### Funnel fixes (given WhatsApp CTA is “bottom of website”)
Prioritize WhatsApp opt-in where attention already exists:
- **Instagram**
  - Add “Join WhatsApp for daily inspiration / class reminders” as **link-in-bio** and **Story Highlight**.
  - Use “keyword opt-in” framing: “DM ‘WHATSAPP’ and we’ll send the join link.”
- **YouTube**
  - Put WhatsApp opt-in link in **video descriptions** and **pinned comments** for relevant series.
- **Event + temple**
  - Put **QR codes** at entrances, registration desks, prasad/canteen areas: “Get reminders on WhatsApp.”
- **Registration forms**
  - Add an explicit checkbox: “Send me updates via WhatsApp (Daily Inspiration / Classes / Events).”
- **Email**
  - Every welcome email includes a clear CTA: “Prefer WhatsApp reminders? Join here.”

### Message design (high-performing + low-risk)
- **Format** (recommended):
  - 1 short headline line
  - 2–4 lines of content (value first)
  - **1 CTA max** (one link)
  - Optional: “Reply STOP to opt out”
- **Length**: target **300–700 characters** for broadcasts; avoid long essays.
- **Links**: use **1 link only**, preferably to a single landing page; add **UTM tags**.
- **Timing**:
  - Pick consistent windows (e.g., mornings for inspiration; evenings for class reminders).
  - Localize by timezone (US vs India).
- **Content mix** (WhatsApp should not feel like promotion):
  - **70% value**: quotes + micro-practices + 1-minute reflection prompt.
  - **20% utility**: schedules, reminders, “starting now,” Zoom links.
  - **10% promotion**: retreats, fundraising, membership.

### Compliance + best-practice guardrails (do not skip)
- WhatsApp requires **explicit opt-in** and expects clear disclosure of **who**, **what**, **how often**, and **how to opt out**.
- Keep a **preference center** (even a simple form): users choose lists + frequency.
- Monitor:
  - opt-in rate, read rate, link clicks
  - block/report signals (qualitative + any provider warnings)

**References (best practice / policy)**
- Meta: Get opt-in for WhatsApp `https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in/`
- WhatsApp Business Policy overview `https://business.whatsapp.com/policy`

## Email cadence recommendations (by audience segment)

### Core principles for JKYog email
- Use email as **relationship + stewardship**, not announcements-only.
- Let people choose frequency (“Weekly digest” vs “Monthly highlights”).
- Segment by **program + lifecycle** (new seeker vs active attendee vs donor).

### Recommended cadence (practical defaults)
1. **General seekers (newsletter list)**
   - **2 emails/month**:  
     - Week 1: “Wisdom + what’s happening” (stories + 1–2 CTAs)  
     - Week 3: “Upcoming events/classes” (region-personalized)
2. **Active class participants**
   - **1/week digest** (schedule + links + key takeaway)  
   - Avoid daily email; use WhatsApp for day-of reminders.
3. **Event registrants (retreat/LTP/festival)**
   - Automated sequence (see workflows below) + **only event-relevant** broadcasts.
4. **Parents (Bal Mukund)**
   - **Weekly operational email** during the term (schedule, what to bring, closures).
   - **Monthly “progress + values at home”** email for retention.
5. **Youth (13+) + YUVA**
   - **1/week** opportunities + highlights + next session reminders.
6. **Donors**
   - **Monthly impact** update (photos/stories + metrics)
   - **1 campaign burst/quarter** (short, time-bound, clear impact)

### “Do / Don’t” (based on retention + unsub risk)
- **Do**
  - Send more consistently than “only monthly when you remember.”
  - Use a **welcome series** to set expectations and route people to WhatsApp/community.
- **Don’t**
  - Send every segment the same newsletter.
  - Stack fundraising + event pushes in the same week to the same people.

**References (cadence best practice)**
- Nonprofit email frequency discussion `https://wiredimpact.com/blog/nonprofit-email-newsletter-frequency/`
- Campaign Monitor guidance `https://campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-often-should-nonprofits-send-emails`

## Social content buckets (with limits + parameters)

### Cross-channel content mix guideline (70/20/10)
- **70% value** (teach, inspire, help practice)
- **20% community/curation** (followers, volunteers, partner centers, festivals, UGC)
- **10% promotion** (registrations, donations, memberships)

(Useful explainer: `https://www.measure.studio/post/70-20-10-rule-for-social-media`)

### Content buckets (JKYog-specific)
Define buckets with tight “rules” so teams can execute consistently:

1. **Wisdom Bites (scripture → modern life)**
   - **Audience**: teens+ (primarily adults)
   - **Format**: Reels/Shorts, carousels, quote cards
   - **Limit**: max 1 core takeaway per post; avoid multi-topic sermons
2. **Practice Prompts (micro-sadhana)**
   - **Audience**: seekers who want consistency
   - **Format**: Stories, short posts, WhatsApp tie-in
   - **Limit**: one actionable step (“Try this for 2 minutes today”)
3. **Event Pathways (what to attend next)**
   - **Audience**: warm followers deciding what to join
   - **Format**: 30–60s explainers, pinned posts, story highlight
   - **Limit**: keep **hard-sell to ≤10%** overall feed
4. **Community + Seva (human stories)**
   - **Audience**: donors/volunteers + trust-building for new followers
   - **Format**: before/after, volunteer spotlights, impact snapshots
   - **Limit**: quantify impact simply (1–3 metrics) + 1 story
5. **Youth/Kids Spotlight**
   - **Audience**: parents + diaspora families
   - **Format**: class snippets, festival activities, testimonials
   - **Limit**: privacy-first; no sensitive child info; parent consent
6. **Myth-busting / FAQs**
   - **Audience**: skeptics + new seekers
   - **Format**: carousel (“3 myths about meditation”), short Q&A clips
   - **Limit**: respectful tone; avoid debates
7. **Kirtan / Devotional Moments**
   - **Audience**: devotional listeners
   - **Format**: short kirtan clips, aarti moments, radio/app CTA
   - **Limit**: add subtitles; keep clips tight (15–45s)
8. **Longform anchors (YouTube/podcast/blog)**
   - **Audience**: deeper learners
   - **Format**: 1–2 weekly “anchor drops,” then repurpose into shorts/quotes
   - **Limit**: every longform release should create 5–10 repurposed assets

### Channel-specific posting limits (to prevent burnout + spam)
- **Instagram**
  - Feed: **3–5 posts/week**
  - Stories: **daily light** (polls, reminders, behind-the-scenes)
  - Live: **2–4/month**
- **YouTube**
  - Shorts: **3–7/week**
  - Longform: **1/week** (or **2/month** if quality-heavy)
- **WhatsApp**
  - Broad segments: **1–2/week**
  - Daily Inspiration: daily (only for explicit opt-in)
- **Email**
  - General list: **2/month**
  - Engaged segments: **weekly digest** max

---

## Automation triggers and workflows (Email + WhatsApp + Community)

### Workflow 1: New subscriber → “Start here” welcome (Email)
- **Trigger**: email signup (any source)
- **Day 0**: Welcome + set expectations + choose interests (Classes / Events / Daily Inspiration / Kids / Youth / YUVA)
- **Day 2**: Best “starter” content (top 3 videos + 1 practice prompt)
- **Day 5**: Invite to WhatsApp (based on selected interests) + community link
- **Day 10**: “What should you join next?” (online class / local center / upcoming event)

### Workflow 2: Instagram follower → WhatsApp opt-in (multi-step)
- **Trigger**: clicks “Join WhatsApp” from IG bio/story OR submits form
- **Instant**: confirmation + list choices (Daily Inspiration vs Reminders)
- **+1 day**: 1 high-value message (no ask)
- **+3 days**: “Pick your path” (online classes / centers / youth/kids)
- **+7 days**: soft CTA (register for a class or attend a satsang)

### Workflow 3: Online class registration → attendance lift (WhatsApp + Email)
- **Trigger**: registers for a class
- **T-24h**: reminder (WhatsApp)
- **T-15m**: “starting soon” (WhatsApp)
- **T+1h**: recap email (key points + recording link + next session)
- **After 3 attends**: invite to community platform + volunteer/service option

### Workflow 4: Event registration (retreat/LTP) → show-up + satisfaction (Email)
- **Trigger**: event registration
- **Immediate**: confirmation + what to expect + add-to-calendar
- **T-7d**: prep guide + “bring a friend”
- **T-1d**: logistics + parking + timing
- **T+1d**: thank-you + highlights + next step (class/center/WhatsApp list)
- **T+7d**: testimonial ask + donation/volunteer soft CTA

### Workflow 5: Lapsed engagement winback (Email)
- **Trigger**: no opens/clicks for 60–90 days (segment-specific)
- **Email 1**: “Still want these updates?” (preference center)
- **Email 2**: “Top 3 most loved teachings this month”
- **Email 3**: “Choose: Monthly only / Events only / Pause”
- **Exit**: suppress if no response (protect deliverability)

### Workflow 6: Donor stewardship (Email + optional WhatsApp)
- **Trigger**: donation
- **Immediate**: receipt + gratitude + what impact this supports
- **T+7d**: “Impact story” (single narrative + photo)
- **Monthly**: impact digest (segment by project/region if possible)
- **Quarterly**: bigger impact report + 1 clear next action

### Workflow 7: Parents (Bal Mukund) onboarding (Email)
- **Trigger**: enrollment
- **Immediate**: schedule + expectations + “how to help your child at home”
- **Weekly**: what’s happening this week
- **Monthly**: progress + upcoming festival/calendar

---

## Measurement (what to track so this doesn’t become “more posting”)
- **WhatsApp**
  - opt-in conversion by source (IG vs site vs event QR)
  - engagement/read + link clicks
  - churn/STOP rate per list
- **Email**
  - open rate, click-to-open rate, unsub rate
  - conversion to next step (class registration / event RSVP)
- **Social**
  - saves/shares (value signal), profile link clicks, video completion rates
- **North-star**
  - repeat attendance (classes/events) + volunteer/donor activation

---
```

---

**User**

JKYog is already very close to a best‑in‑class funnel; the main gaps are (a) surfacing WhatsApp and email at the exact “intent moments” and (b) enforcing strict segmentation so no one ever feels spammed.
Below is a focused suggestion set you can implement in phases.
1. Clarify the funnel “contract”
Articulate your funnel in one simple internal sentence and let it drive all tactics:
TOFU: IG + YouTube + events = reach, inspiration, light invites.
MOFU: WhatsApp + email = reminders, next steps, community.
BOFU: Community + volunteer/donor flows = lifetime relationship.
Every new asset should explicitly answer: “What list / community does this move people into?” so content teams are not just “posting more.”
2. Fix the WhatsApp funnel architecture
A. Make WhatsApp the default “next step” from social
Right now, the website CTA is buried; you’ll grow 5–10x faster by capturing intent directly from discovery.
Prioritize:
Instagram:
Add “Join WhatsApp for Daily Inspiration / Class Reminders” in link‑in‑bio and a Story Highlight.
Run periodic Stories using “DM WHATSAPP for the link” so you stay inside the “user‑initiated” opt‑in rule.
YouTube:
For teaching series, pin a top comment: “Want reminders and micro‑practices on WhatsApp? Join here.”
Add the same link (with UTM) in the first two lines of the description; this materially improves click‑through for NGOs.
B. Tighten WhatsApp list design (no “blast all”)
Your proposed lists are exactly what WhatsApp and Meta expect from compliant, relevant messaging.
Implement:
Separate entry points (links/QRs) per list:
Daily Inspiration (global)
Online Class Reminders (per course or per “track”)
Events (per center/region)
Parents, Youth/YUVA, Donors/Seva
Each entry point has a short disclosure: who (JKYog/Temple), what they’ll receive, approximate frequency, and how to stop.
This keeps block/STOP rates low and protects the account long‑term.
3. WhatsApp message patterns you can standardize
A. Templates by list
Daily Inspiration
1‑line hook + 2 lines reflection + 1 tiny practice, link only if truly needed.
Example: “Today, notice one moment where you could respond with patience instead of impulse.” (No link.) This fits the “relationship channel, not pure broadcast” guidance for NGOs.
Class Reminders
Two touches max per session: T‑24h and T‑15m.
Use consistent structure: “When, where, what you need, link.” Short messages have higher reply and CTR for NGOs.
Events / Donors
Follow the 3‑message appeal–proof–reminder pattern already validated in NGO WhatsApp fundraising.
Always keep an easy opt‑out line (“Reply STOP to opt out”) and avoid pressure language.
B. Guardrails
300–700 characters, 1 link, 1 CTA; this is in line with high‑performing nonprofit WhatsApp campaigns.
Use different sending windows by list (e.g., Daily Inspiration mornings, logistics closer to event/class times).
Track per‑list STOP/block and pull back quickly on any segment that trends high.
4. Email: make it “anchor + router,” not blast
Your cadence recommendations are aligned with current nonprofit best practice: most effective orgs are at monthly–biweekly for general lists and weekly for highly engaged segments.
A. Simplify into 3 core email “products”
General seekers newsletter (2x/month)
Issue A: “Wisdom + what’s happening” (one teaching, a story, 1–2 CTAs).
Issue B: “Upcoming classes and events” with region‑relevant sections.
Program digests (weekly max)
Online class, Youth, Bal Mukund: 1 operational email / week with schedule + 1 key takeaway + “add to calendar.”
Donor & Seva list
1 monthly impact/story email + 1 short, time‑bound campaign per quarter; 60 emails/year is an upper boundary many nonprofit experts recommend not crossing.
B. Use email to push people into WhatsApp + community
Welcome series (you already outlined) is crucial: best practice is to use it to set expectations and immediately ask for preference + channel (email vs WhatsApp).
Add WhatsApp CTAs in:
Every welcome email.
Post‑event and post‑class follow‑ups (“Prefer WhatsApp reminders? Join here.”).
This turns email from “another channel” into a routing and education layer.
5. Automation: start with 3 workflows first
You have many great flows; to avoid overwhelm, implement in order of impact:
New subscriber → Start‑here welcome (Email + optional WhatsApp join)
This aligns with nonprofit advice to use a short automated series rather than sporadic newsletters.
Online class registration → Attendance lift
T‑24h, T‑15m WhatsApp reminders, plus T+1h recap email with recording and next step.
This is where WhatsApp shines for NGOs: reminders significantly improve show‑up and follow‑through.
Event registration (retreat/LTP/festival) → Show‑up + satisfaction
Confirmation, preparation, logistics, and T+7d testimonial/donation ask.
Mirrors standard nonprofit event automation that boosts both attendance and post‑event giving.
Once these three run smoothly, layer in donor stewardship and lapsed‑engagement winback.
6. Social content: lock the 70/20/10 rule into planning
Your 70/20/10 breakdown tracks directly with current social media guidance: 70% value, 20% curated/community, 10% promotional.
To make it executable:
Build a simple “content calendar grid” for IG and YouTube:
Rows = days; columns = bucket (Wisdom, Practice, Pathways, Community, Youth, Kirtan, etc.).
Mark only 10% of slots in red (promotion). Everything else must teach, inspire, or spotlight people.
Link each post type to a funnel action:
Wisdom/Practice → “Save + share + join WhatsApp for daily inspiration.”
Event Pathways → “Register” (link‑in‑bio) or “Join local center WhatsApp.”
Community/Seva → “Volunteer interest” form or WhatsApp Seva list.
This keeps the promotional load small while still driving registrations and donations.
7. Measurement and governance
Anchor your dashboards to behaviors, not vanity metrics, in line with current nonprofit digital guidance.
Track:
WhatsApp: opt‑in rate by source (IG vs site vs QR), read + click, STOP/block rate by list.
Email: open, click‑to‑open, unsub per segment, plus downstream metrics (class/event attendance, donation).!
Social: saves, shares, profile link clicks, video completion.
Then define one north star: “repeat attendance + volunteer/donor activation per 1,000 social followers.” If this goes up over 3–6 months, the playbook is working, even if follower counts or vanity metrics move slowly.
If you share which 2–3 segments matter most in the next 90 days (e.g., India retreats, online Gita classes, YUVA), I can turn this into a concrete 12‑week rollout plan with example WhatsApp and email copy per workflow.

**Cursor**

You’re very close. The only meaningful “missing pieces” are the operational and governance layers that keep a best-in-class funnel from degrading over time, plus a couple of high-leverage intent moments you haven’t explicitly wired yet.

WHAT YOU MAY BE MISSING (ADD THESE)

1) A preference center + “channel choice” contract (critical)
Right now you’re correctly focused on segmentation, but you also need an explicit mechanism for subscribers to choose:
- Topics: Daily Inspiration, Online Classes, Events, Kids, Youth/YUVA, Seva/Donors
- Frequency: Daily / Weekly / Monthly (where relevant)
- Region/timezone (US/India + center)
- Channel: WhatsApp vs Email (or both)

This does two things:
- Prevents spam perception even when volume rises.
- Creates a clean internal rule: “We only message what the user chose.”

Even a simple form works initially; the key is linking it everywhere (welcome emails, footer, WhatsApp keyword flow, post-event follow-ups).

2) A single identity layer (dedupe + lifecycle tracking)
You’ll get messy fast without a unified contact record. You need a way to link one person across:
- Instagram/YouTube click → landing page
- Email signup
- WhatsApp opt-in
- Class registrations
- Event registrations
- Donor/volunteer actions
- Community membership (Mighty Networks)
- Center affiliation

Minimum viable: one CRM/list system with a unique key (email + phone), strict dedupe rules, and tags for segment + consent + source + last engagement. Without this, people receive conflicting messages and your “no spam” promise breaks.

3) WhatsApp: broadcast vs group vs API templates (channel mechanics)
Your strategy assumes broadcast/list messaging. Operationally, you should define:
- When you use a broadcast list (one-way updates)
- When you use a group (two-way community / peer support)
- When you need WhatsApp Business Platform templates (for proactive reminders outside the 24-hour window in many setups)

You don’t have to adopt the API immediately, but you should design your flows so migrating later doesn’t require rethinking segmentation and consent language.

4) Consent language standardization + audit trail (risk control)
You referenced user-initiated opt-in correctly. Next step is standardizing opt-in copy everywhere:
- “You’ll receive X from JKYog, about Y, ~Z times/week. Reply STOP to opt out.”

Also keep an audit trail: source URL/QR, timestamp, list chosen, disclosure shown. This is how serious orgs protect deliverability and account health long-term.

5) Deliverability hygiene (email and WhatsApp)
Email:
- Define list hygiene rules (e.g., suppress after 90 days unengaged; re-permission flow)
- Separate transactional vs marketing streams
- Set a target for complaint/unsub thresholds; if exceeded, automatically reduce frequency or narrow segment

WhatsApp:
- Define STOP/block thresholds per list (e.g., if STOP rate spikes, pause that segment and revise content)
- Avoid repeated links and repeated asks; WhatsApp is sensitive to “broadcast-y” behavior

6) A “content to conversion” routing map (so content isn’t just content)
You’ve said: “Every asset should answer what list/community it moves people into.” Make that executable:
- For each content bucket, define exactly one primary next step
  - Wisdom/Practice: join Daily Inspiration WhatsApp OR weekly digest email
  - Online class clips: join class reminders WhatsApp + one-click registration
  - Youth/YUVA: join YUVA membership or youth list
  - Seva stories: join volunteer interest + donor impact list
  - Kirtan: radio/app + devotional WhatsApp list (optional)

Then enforce: each post has only one main CTA. This reduces friction and improves conversion.

7) “Intent moments” you haven’t explicitly listed (high leverage)
These are moments where users are unusually receptive to opting in, beyond IG/YouTube:
- After someone completes an online class registration (immediate WhatsApp reminder opt-in prompt)
- After someone attends a class (recap email that offers WhatsApp reminders)
- After someone watches a long YouTube teaching (end screen + pinned comment: “Get the practice prompts on WhatsApp”)
- At the physical venue: entry/exit QR, prasad line QR, volunteer desk QR
- On donation confirmation: “Choose impact updates frequency” + optional WhatsApp impact list

8) A/B testing plan (lightweight, but explicit)
You don’t need complex experimentation, just consistent iteration:
- WhatsApp CTA placement: bio vs highlights vs pinned post vs story sequence
- Opt-in framing: “daily inspiration” vs “reminders” vs “micro-practices”
- Welcome series length (3 vs 5 emails)
- WhatsApp message timing windows per timezone

Without this, teams default to opinions and you lose months.

9) Automation “failure modes” (what happens when something breaks)
Add operational guardrails:
- If Zoom link changes last-minute: one “urgent update” template and process
- If a broadcast goes out with the wrong link: correction protocol
- If a list spikes in STOPs: automatic cooldown and review
- If a registration form fails: fallback link and monitoring

Best funnels include “incident response” because operational slip-ups are what cause unsubscribes and WhatsApp blocks.

10) Youth/kids privacy and permissions (especially important for Bal Mukund)
You’re spotlighting kids/youth content. Add strict policies:
- Consent for photos/videos
- No personally identifying details
- Clear separation: parent communications vs youth communications

This is both trust-building and risk reduction.

11) Governance: ownership, cadence, and a simple approval system
Define roles so the system runs:
- One owner for segmentation + list hygiene
- One owner for WhatsApp messaging calendar (per list)
- One owner for email calendar + automations
- One owner for measurement
- Lightweight approval (especially for donation asks, crisis messaging, youth content)

Without governance, “best-in-class” becomes inconsistent and spammy over time.

12) Measurement: add 2–3 leading indicators (not just outcomes)
You already have a strong measurement section. The missing part is leading indicators that predict long-term growth:
- WhatsApp opt-in conversion rate from IG story views (or link clicks)
- % of registrants who join reminders list
- Repeat attendance rate (2nd session attendance within 30 days)
- Preference center completion rate (signals “quality” subscribers)

RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS TO YOUR CURRENT TEXT (SMALL INSERTS)
- Add one short paragraph explicitly requiring a preference center + audit trail for opt-ins.
- Add a short “identity + dedupe” section.
- Add an “operating system” section: ownership, hygiene, and incident response.
- Add 4–5 missing intent moments (post-registration, post-attendance, venue QR, donation confirmation).
- Add privacy guardrails for youth/kids.

If you tell me which stack you’re using (email platform, forms, CRM, WhatsApp tool—Business App vs API), I can translate these missing pieces into concrete workflows and rules (exact tags, suppression logic, and the minimum set of lists to launch without risking WhatsApp account health).

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (fix funnel + run broadcasts safely)

**What WhatsApp should do for JKYog**
- **Retention + attendance lift**: class reminders, “start now” links, habit-building prompts.
- **Local community activation**: center/temple events, festival logistics.
- **Stewardship**: volunteers/donors get impact and coordination updates (not general blasts).

**Core diagnosis (from current signals)**
- WhatsApp is **not being captured at intent moments** (CTA buried on site); discovery is happening on **Instagram (~614k)** while WhatsApp is small (~1.4k). Treat this as a funnel-placement problem, not a “WhatsApp demand” problem.

**List architecture (no “blast all”)**
Create separate opt-ins (separate links/QRs) for:
- **Daily Inspiration (Adults/seekers)**: 1 value message/day (only for explicit daily opt-in).
- **Online Class Reminders (Adults + families)**: max **2 reminders/session** (T-24h, T-15m).
- **Events by region/center (All ages)**: **1–2/week** + urgent logistics.
- **Parents: Bal Mukund (Kids 5–15)**: **1/week** ops update + urgent changes only.
- **Youth Club (Ages 13+)**: **1/week** schedule + opportunities + reminders.
- **YUVA (College + young professionals, ~18–30)**: **1/week** talks + Q&A + book club.
- **Seva/Donors (Adults)**: **2–4/month** impact + specific campaigns.

**Opt-in “contract” (required on every entry point)**
- Who: “JKYog / Radha Krishna Temple”
- What: “Daily inspiration / reminders / event updates…”
- Frequency: “~X per week”
- Opt-out: “Reply STOP to opt out”
- Store opt-in source + timestamp (audit trail).

**Where to surface WhatsApp (highest leverage intent moments)**
- **Instagram**: link-in-bio + Story Highlight + periodic Stories (“DM ‘WHATSAPP’ for the link”) + pinned post.
- **YouTube**: pinned comment + first two lines of description for series.
- **Registration flows** (classes/events/youth/kids): checkbox + list selection (“Reminders via WhatsApp”).
- **In-person**: QR codes at entry, info desk, prasad line, volunteer desk.
- **Email**: every welcome + post-event recap includes “Prefer WhatsApp reminders? Join.”

**Message standards (to prevent spam/blocks)**
- **300–700 chars**, **1 link**, **1 CTA**, value-first.
- Timing by list (e.g., inspiration mornings; reminders close to start time).
- Track per-list **STOP rate**, clicks, and attendance lift; if STOP spikes, pause and revise that segment.

---

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (segment-first, preference-led)

**Email’s job in the funnel**
- Be the **anchor + router**: explain “what to do next,” personalize by journey, and route to WhatsApp/community/centers.
- Avoid “everything to everyone” blasts.

**3 core email products (simple, scalable)**
1) **General seekers newsletter (2x/month)**  
- Issue A: “Wisdom + story + 1–2 next steps”  
- Issue B: “Upcoming classes/events” with region-relevant blocks

2) **Program digests (weekly max, only for opted-in segments)**  
- Online classes digest, Youth digest (13+), Bal Mukund parents digest (5–15)  
- Template: schedule + 1 key takeaway + single CTA (register/join/recording)

3) **Donor/Seva email (monthly impact + quarterly campaign burst)**  
- Monthly: 1 story + 1–3 metrics + gratitude  
- Quarterly: short, time-bound appeal tied to clear outcomes

**Recommended cadence by segment**
- **New subscriber**: 4-email welcome series over ~10 days (sets preferences + invites WhatsApp).
- **General list**: **2/month** default.
- **Highly engaged learners (classes)**: **1/week** digest (not more).
- **Event registrants**: automated event sequence only (no extra blasts).
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: weekly ops during term + monthly “values at home” optional.
- **Youth/YUVA**: **1/week** opportunities + reminders (or biweekly if content is light).

**Deliverability + trust guardrails**
- Add a simple **preference center** (“Topics + frequency + region”).
- Suppress or re-permission after **60–90 days unengaged** (protects deliverability).
- Keep transactional (receipts/confirmations) separate from marketing sends.

---

### 6) Social content buckets (with guardrails + CTAs that feed MOFU)

**Operating rule (keeps it non-spammy)**
- **70% value**, **20% community/curation**, **10% promotion**.

**Content buckets (each with one primary CTA)**
1) **Wisdom → Modern Life (teens+, mostly adults)**  
- Reels/Shorts, carousels, quotes with 1 takeaway  
- CTA: “Save/share + join WhatsApp Daily Inspiration”

2) **Micro-Practice Prompts (teens+, adults)**  
- 15–30s practice, 2-minute reflection, meditation snippet  
- CTA: “Get daily prompts on WhatsApp”

3) **Event Pathways (all ages)**  
- “What is LTP/retreat?”, “What to expect”, “Who it’s for”  
- CTA: “Register” OR “Join your local events WhatsApp list” (pick one)

4) **Community + Seva Stories (adults, donors/volunteers, trust-building)**  
- Volunteer spotlights, impact updates, behind-the-scenes  
- CTA: “Volunteer interest form” OR “Impact email list” (pick one)

5) **Kids/Parents: Bal Mukund highlights (parents; kids 5–15)**  
- Festivals, learning moments, curriculum snippets (privacy-first)  
- CTA: “Enroll / join parent updates list”

6) **Youth Club (13+) + YUVA (~18–30)**  
- leadership, career exploration, student Q&A clips  
- CTA: “Join Youth/YUVA membership/list”

7) **Devotional/Kirtan/Ritual moments (all ages)**  
- short kirtans, aarti moments, radio/app snippets  
- CTA: “Listen on JKYog Radio / subscribe”

8) **Longform anchors → clips (adults + deep learners)**  
- One weekly longform (YouTube/podcast/blog), repurposed into 5–10 shorts  
- CTA: “Watch full teaching / subscribe to weekly digest”

**Posting limits (so quality stays high)**
- IG: **3–5 feed posts/week**, Stories daily light, Lives **2–4/month**  
- YouTube: Shorts **3–7/week**, longform **1/week** (or 2/month)  
- Promotion cap: **≤10%** of total posts.

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (multi-channel, journey-based)

**Workflow design rule**
- Start with **3 high-impact automations** (welcome, class attendance lift, event show-up). Add donor/volunteer winback later.

#### A) New subscriber → “Start here” onboarding (Email-first, WhatsApp optional)
**Trigger**: email signup (any source)  
- Day 0: Welcome + choose interests (Classes / Events / Daily Inspiration / Kids / Youth / YUVA / Seva)  
- Day 2: Best starter content (top 3) + “join WhatsApp for reminders/prompts”  
- Day 5: Route to next step (online class or local center)  
- Day 10: Ask preference update + invite community (if relevant)

#### B) Online class registration → attendance lift (WhatsApp + Email)
**Trigger**: registers for a class  
- T-24h: WhatsApp reminder  
- T-15m: WhatsApp “starting soon” + link  
- T+1h: recap email (key points + recording + next session link)  
- After 3 attended sessions: invite community + volunteer soft CTA

#### C) Event registration (retreat/LTP/festival) → show-up + satisfaction (Email + optional WhatsApp)
**Trigger**: event registration  
- Immediate: confirmation + add-to-calendar + logistics basics  
- T-7d: preparation + what to expect  
- T-1d: final logistics  
- T+1d: thank you + highlights + next step (class/center/WhatsApp list)  
- T+7d: testimonial + donation/volunteer soft ask

#### D) Volunteer signup → activation ladder (Email + WhatsApp for ops)
**Trigger**: volunteer interest form submitted  
- Immediate: welcome + role options + training schedule  
- Week 1: first shift scheduling + mentor assignment  
- After first event: recognition + “next responsibility” invite  
- After 3 shifts: coordinator pathway invite

#### E) Donor stewardship (Email; WhatsApp only if explicitly opted-in)
**Trigger**: donation  
- Immediate: receipt + impact statement  
- T+7d: story-based impact proof  
- Monthly: impact digest  
- Quarterly: campaign burst (time-bound, specific)

**Cross-channel triggers (simple but powerful)**
- If user clicks “WhatsApp” but doesn’t complete opt-in → send a 24h email reminder (only if they gave email).
- If user attends 0 sessions after registering → 1 gentle nudge (then stop).
- If subscriber inactive 60–90 days → preference check / winback (then suppress).

**SMS usage (optional)**
- Only for **critical logistics** (event day changes) and only for explicit SMS opt-in—otherwise it increases “spam feel” for spiritual/community orgs.

If you want, I can rewrite these four sections in the exact voice/style of your team deliverable (shorter, more “consulting doc”), but the substance above is the complete content for points **4–7** under Task 6.

---

**User**

Opt-in “contract” (required on every entry point)
Who: “JKYog / Radha Krishna Temple”
What: “Daily inspiration / reminders / event updates…”
Frequency: “~X per week”
Opt-out: “Reply STOP to opt out”
Store opt-in source + timestamp (audit trail).

would it be better to just simple keep it as opt in and out out instead of this

---

**Cursor**

Keeping it **simple is good**, but you shouldn’t drop the “contract” entirely.

### What’s the best approach
- **User-facing**: keep it **very short** (opt-in + opt-out), so it doesn’t hurt conversions.
- **Operational/compliance**: still capture the rest (who/what/frequency/source/timestamp) either **in the same line** or **behind the scenes**.

### Why you still want the extra pieces (even if minimal)
- **Reduces spam complaints/blocks**: people get annoyed when they didn’t expect *what kind* of messages they start receiving.
- **Protects deliverability/account health**: WhatsApp/email platforms are sensitive to user reports.
- **Prevents internal misuse**: teams are less likely to “blast everyone” if the list purpose is explicit.
- **Audit trail**: if someone complains, you can prove when/how they opted in.

### A “simple but sufficient” opt-in version (recommended)
Use a single short line (works for web forms, WhatsApp join pages, event QR pages):

- “Opt in to receive **JKYog updates on WhatsApp** (daily inspiration + class/event reminders, up to **X/week**). **Reply STOP to opt out**.”

If you want it even shorter:

- “Get **JKYog WhatsApp updates**. **Reply STOP to opt out**.”

…but only use the ultra-short version if you also:
- **separate lists** (daily vs reminders vs events), and
- show **frequency** at least on the list landing page.

### What to store internally (even if not shown prominently)
- list name (Daily Inspiration / Class Reminders / Events-Region)
- opt-in source (IG bio, YouTube, QR, web footer, registration form)
- timestamp
- consent text version shown (so you know what they agreed to)

**Bottom line**: don’t keep a long “Who/What/Frequency” block everywhere. Keep the UI copy minimal—but include at least **who + what kind of messages + STOP**, and keep the audit details internally.

---

**User**

this point doesn't make much sense tbh, explain it in a simpler way

---

**Cursor**

Think of the “opt-in contract” as a **promise** you make so people don’t feel tricked after they join.

### Why “just opt in / opt out” can be risky
If someone clicks “Join WhatsApp” and later starts getting (for example) **daily messages**, or **donation asks**, they’ll think:
- “I didn’t sign up for this,”  
and they’ll **block/report** you (which hurts your WhatsApp account and future reach).

### The simple fix
You don’t need a long legal paragraph. You just need **one short sentence** that answers:

- **Who is messaging me?** (JKYog / RKT)
- **What will I get?** (daily inspiration vs class reminders vs event updates)
- **How often-ish?** (daily / weekly / only when there’s an event)
- **How do I stop?** (reply STOP)

### Example (short enough to not hurt signups)
- “Get **JKYog class reminders** on WhatsApp (1–2/week). Reply **STOP** to opt out.”

Or for daily:
- “Get **JKYog daily inspiration** on WhatsApp (1/day). Reply **STOP** to opt out.”

### The “audit trail” part (even simpler)
Internally, you just save:
- where they joined from (IG / website / QR)
- when they joined

This helps you debug and prove consent if someone complains.

SMS usage (optional)
Only for critical logistics (event day changes) and only for explicit SMS opt-in—otherwise it increases “spam feel” for spiritual/community orgs.

this is good, but i want the numbers to be valid or verifiable. 

also, for each of the sections, check online for corresponding best practices implementable by the techstacks proposed.



---

**Cursor**

I’ll pull a handful of primary docs and credible benchmarks (Meta/WhatsApp policies, nonprofit email frequency research, and Podium/GHL/Constant Contact workflow capabilities), then I’ll rewrite sections 4–7 with only **verifiable numbers** and stack-specific implementation notes.

Great—now we have sources for (a) WhatsApp opt-in requirements and the 24-hour window/templates, (b) nonprofit email frequency benchmarks with specific numbers, and (c) social “content pillars” limits (3–5 pillars) plus the 70/20/10 mix. Next I’ll pull the specific policy pages and Podium/GHL docs so we can tie each recommendation to what those stacks can actually do.

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (numbers that are verifiable + stack-implementable)

**Verifiable constraints you must design around**
- **Opt-in is required**: WhatsApp says you may only contact people if they gave you their number **and** you received **opt-in permission** to receive subsequent messages/calls. Source: [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy)
- **Category-level opt-in is explicitly recommended**: WhatsApp’s best practices say to obtain **separate opt-in by specific message category** (to reduce blocks). Source: [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy → Best Practices for Opt-In](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy)
- **24-hour window + escalation paths**: WhatsApp policy references using automation “during the 24-hour window” and requires clear escalation paths (email/phone/web/in-chat human transfer, etc.). Source: [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy)
- **Templates exist on the platform** (needed for business-initiated messaging on the Business Platform): Source: [Meta WhatsApp Template Messages docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates/)

**What’s “verifiable” vs what’s a starting hypothesis**
- WhatsApp does **not** publish a universal “safe messages per week” number. So any “X/week” is a **JKYog default to test**, not a policy-backed number.
- What *is* verifiable: **opt-in**, **separate opt-in by category**, and **window/escalation requirements**.

**List architecture (aligned to WhatsApp best-practice: category opt-in)**
Use **separate entry points** (links/QRs/forms) per category:
- Daily Inspiration
- Class Reminders
- Events (by center/region)
- Parents (Bal Mukund)
- Youth (13+)
- YUVA (students/young professionals)
- Seva/Donors

This is directly aligned with WhatsApp’s “separate opt-in by message category” best practice. Source: [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy)

**Tech stack implementation notes**
- **If using WhatsApp Business App**: segmentation is mostly **manual** (labels/lists), limited automation.
- **If using WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud/API)**: you can operationalize templates, tracking, and integrations (via Solution Provider or custom build). Source: [Meta template docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates/)
- **If using GoHighLevel (GHL)**: you can automate cross-channel flows (email/SMS/internal notifications; webhooks) and route leads—WhatsApp sending depends on your WhatsApp integration/provider, but workflow logic is supported.

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (verifiable benchmarks + implementable on stacks)

**Verifiable nonprofit frequency benchmarks**
- In a nonprofit benchmark summary, Wired Impact cites the **2011 Nonprofit Communications Trends Report** distribution:
  - **Monthly 43%**, **every other week 17%**, **weekly 12%**, **quarterly 16%** (others smaller). Source: [Wired Impact](https://wiredimpact.com/blog/nonprofit-email-newsletter-frequency/)
- Wired Impact also cites Mailchimp + HubSpot data: orgs sending **once per month** had a **78% higher unsubscribe rate** than those sending **12/month**, and unsubscribe rates drop when frequency increases to **1–6 emails/month**. Source: [Wired Impact](https://wiredimpact.com/blog/nonprofit-email-newsletter-frequency/)

**Cadence recommendation (anchored to the “1–6 emails/month” evidence)**
- **General seekers list**: **2/month** (fits inside 1–6/month; common nonprofit norm).
- **Highly engaged segments (classes / youth / parents)**: **weekly digest** (≈4/month; still inside the 1–6/month range).
- **Event registrants**: event-only automation sequence (counts are “as needed,” but time-bound).
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + occasional campaign bursts (keep predictable).

### 6) Social content buckets (verifiable best-practice numbers + stack-implementable ops)

**Verifiable “how many buckets/pillars” guidance**
- Sprout Social recommends having **~3–5 content pillars at any one time** and warns against too many (dilutes message). Source: [Sprout Social — Content Pillars](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-content-pillars/)

**JKYog recommended pillars (keep it within the 3–5 range)**
Pick **5 pillars max** so the system is operational:
1) Wisdom → Modern life (teachings + practical application)
2) Practice prompts (micro-sadhana / meditation / habit)
3) Community + Seva (stories, volunteers, impact)
4) Pathways (what to attend next: class/center/event)
5) Youth & Family (Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA)

**Implementation guardrail (verifiable + practical)**
- Tag every post by pillar (Sprout calls out tagging as the way to measure pillar performance). Source: [Sprout Social — Content Pillars](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-content-pillars/)

**Tech stack implementation notes**
- This is mostly a **process** layer (calendar + tagging + measurement). Any scheduling/analytics tool works; if you’re using GHL, it can help with downstream routing (forms/UTMs → CRM tags → workflows), but pillar strategy itself is platform-agnostic.

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (verifiable capabilities + what you can actually automate with the stacks)

**Verifiable automation capability (GHL)**
- GHL defines workflows as trigger → actions, and supports advanced constructs like **IF/Else**, **webhooks**, chaining workflows. Source: [GHL Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002288-getting-started-with-workflows)

**What you can implement with GHL (clean mapping)**
1) **New subscriber → Start-here onboarding**
   - **Trigger**: Contact created / form submitted
   - **Actions**: send email sequence, apply tags (“interest: classes/events/inspiration”), IF/Else branches
   - **Source**: GHL workflow triggers/actions model. [GHL Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002288-getting-started-with-workflows)

2) **Online class registration → attendance lift**
   - **Trigger**: Form submitted (class registration)
   - **Actions**: add to “class reminders” segment, schedule reminder emails/SMS, webhook to WhatsApp provider (if used)

3) **Event registration → show-up + post-event loop**
   - **Trigger**: form submitted / appointment booked (if events use booking)
   - **Actions**: confirmation email, timed reminders, post-event survey, route to next step

4) **Volunteer signup → activation ladder**
   - **Trigger**: volunteer interest form
   - **Actions**: onboarding series + internal notifications + assign tasks (depending on configuration)

5) **Donor stewardship**
   - **Trigger**: payment event (if payments are tracked/integrated) or form submission
   - **Actions**: receipt email (often handled by payment tool) + stewardship series in GHL/Constant Contact

**Podium-specific: what’s verifiable and usable**
- Podium publishes guidance on **SMS segmentation** and **keywords**, and has an API endpoint for **contact opt-out** (useful for compliance). Sources:
  - [Podium: SMS segmentation article](https://www.podium.com/article/sms-segmentation)
  - [Podium: SMS keywords article](https://www.podium.com/article/sms-keywords)
  - [Podium API: opt out a contact](https://docs.podium.com/reference/contactopt_out)

**WhatsApp automation reality check (so it’s accurate)**
- If JKYog is operating WhatsApp purely via **WhatsApp Business App**, most “workflows” are manual.
- If they use **WhatsApp Business Platform**, then template-driven messaging and integrations become feasible (and should respect opt-in/category rules). Sources:
  - [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy)
  - [Meta template messages docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates/)

---

If you want, paste the **actual proposed stack** you’re using in `channel-strategy.md` (Podium + Constant Contact + WhatsApp Business App? or GHL + WhatsApp Platform?), and I’ll tighten each section to *only* the workflows that are realistically implementable in that exact toolchain (no “hand-wavy” automations).

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (verifiable constraints + implementable by proposed stacks)

**Verifiable constraints you must design around**
- **Opt-in is required**: WhatsApp states you may only contact people on WhatsApp if (a) they provided their mobile number and (b) you received **opt-in permission** confirming they want subsequent messages/calls from you. [1]  
- **Category-level opt-in is a recommended best practice**: WhatsApp recommends obtaining **separate opt-in by specific message category** to reduce the risk of users blocking the business. [1]  
- **24-hour window + escalation paths**: WhatsApp policy allows automation when responding during the **24-hour window**, but requires prompt and direct escalation paths (e.g., email, phone, web support, in-chat human agent transfer). [1]  
- **Message templates exist for the WhatsApp Business Platform** and are the standard mechanism for business-initiated messaging on the platform. [2]

**List architecture (aligned to WhatsApp’s category-opt-in best practice)**
Create **separate opt-ins** (separate links/QRs/forms) for:
- Daily Inspiration  
- Online Class Reminders  
- Events (by center/region)  
- Parents (Bal Mukund)  
- Youth (13+)  
- YUVA (college students/young professionals)  
- Seva/Donors  

This directly implements WhatsApp’s best practice: “obtain separate opt-in by specific message category.” [1]

**Tech stack implementation notes**
- **WhatsApp Business App**: segmentation is mostly **manual** (lists/labels), limited automation; still follow category opt-ins. [1]  
- **WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud/API)**: supports template-based messaging and technical integrations; design flows around approved templates where needed. [2]  
- **GoHighLevel (GHL)**: supports workflow automation using triggers → actions, plus IF/Else branching and webhooks (useful for routing leads, tagging segments, and triggering sends via integrated channels/providers). [3]

---

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (verifiable benchmark numbers + implementable automations)

**Verifiable nonprofit frequency benchmarks**
- Wired Impact cites the **2011 Nonprofit Communications Trends Report** frequencies: **Monthly 43%**, **Every Other Week 17%**, **Weekly 12%**, **Quarterly 16%** (other categories smaller). [4]  
- Wired Impact also cites Mailchimp + HubSpot data: sending **once per month** is associated with a **78% higher unsubscribe rate** than sending **12 emails/month**, and unsubscribe rates drop significantly when increasing frequency to **1–6 emails/month**. [4]

**Cadence recommendation (anchored to the “1–6 emails/month” range)**
- **General seekers list**: **2 emails/month** (fits within 1–6/month). [4]  
- **Highly engaged segments (classes / youth / parents)**: **weekly digest** (~4/month; still within 1–6/month). [4]  
- **Donor list**: **monthly impact email** + occasional time-bound campaigns (keep predictable; avoid stacking). [4]

**Tech stack implementation notes**
- **GoHighLevel**: supports automated sequences triggered by contact/form events and can branch logic via filters and IF/Else conditions. [3]  
- **Constant Contact**: supports automated welcome series and email marketing automation features suitable for onboarding and routing subscribers into the right segments. [5]

---

### 6) Social content buckets (verifiable best-practice limits + operationalizable)

**Verifiable best-practice limit**
- Sprout Social recommends **~3–5 content pillars at any one time** and warns that too many pillars can dilute the brand message. [6]

**JKYog recommended pillars (keep it at 5 max)**
1) Wisdom → Modern life (teachings + practical application)  
2) Practice prompts (micro-sadhana / meditation / habit)  
3) Community + Seva (volunteer stories + impact)  
4) Pathways (what to do next: class/center/event)  
5) Youth & Family (Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA)

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (verifiable platform capability + realistic scope)

**Verifiable automation capability (GoHighLevel)**
- GHL defines workflows as a **triggered sequence of actions**, and documents triggers/actions plus advanced capabilities like **IF/Else**, **webhooks**, and chaining workflows. [3]

**Workflows you can implement with GHL (stack-aligned)**
- **New subscriber → Start-here onboarding**
  - Trigger: contact created / form submitted  
  - Actions: welcome sequence, tag by interest, branch with IF/Else, route to WhatsApp/email preference capture. [3]  
- **Online class registration → attendance lift**
  - Trigger: class form submission  
  - Actions: timed reminders (email/SMS), post-class recap, apply “attended” tags, invite to community. [3]  
- **Event registration → show-up + satisfaction**
  - Trigger: event form submission/booking  
  - Actions: confirmation, timed reminders, post-event follow-up, testimonial request, next-step routing. [3]

**Podium (if used for SMS ops)**
- Podium provides guidance on SMS **segmentation** and **keywords**, and an API endpoint to **opt out a contact** (useful for compliance and suppression). [7][8][9]

**User**

you need to undersand that rather than just general business practices, it needs be specific to jkyogs use case. so go through the requirements of the project and based on the context complete 4,5,6,7 of the 6th task

---

**Cursor**

Below is a **JKYog-specific** write-up for **Task 6, sections 4–7** (WhatsApp, email, social buckets, and automation). It’s grounded in (a) JKYog’s *actual* programs/channels (Online Classes + WhatsApp reminders, centers, Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA, SMEx, Mighty Networks community), and (b) the project’s 3 core journeys.

---

## 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (JKYog-specific: intent moments + program routing)

### 4.1 What WhatsApp should do for JKYog (mapped to the 3 journeys)
- **Journey 1 (New devotee → first event → recurring attendee)**: reduce drop-off between “interest” and “showing up” using **reminders + logistics + next-step prompts** (join a center, join a weekly class, attend next satsang).
- **Journey 2 (Online consumer → donor → major donor)**: convert “content-only” users into relationship by delivering **value-first inspiration** + occasional **impact proof** + *non-pushy* donation pathways.
- **Journey 3 (Volunteer signup → active volunteer → coordinator)**: use WhatsApp for **ops coordination** (shifts, checklists, urgent changes), not for general marketing.

### 4.2 Non-negotiables from WhatsApp policy (so JKYog doesn’t get flagged)
- JKYog may only message people if they provided their number **and** gave **opt-in permission**. [1]  
- WhatsApp explicitly recommends **separate opt-in by message category** to reduce blocks. [1]  
- Policy also notes automation during the **24-hour window** and requires clear escalation paths (email/phone/web/in-chat human transfer). [1]  
- If JKYog ever moves to WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud/API), template messaging is the formal mechanism to message at scale. [2]

### 4.3 Current JKYog WhatsApp entry points (use what already exists)
JKYog already uses multiple WhatsApp join paths:
- **Swami Mukundananda Inspiration broadcast** is promoted on JKYog’s social media page via a `jkyog.live` registration link. (This is a *real, existing funnel asset*—it just needs to be surfaced at better intent moments.)  
  Source: JKYog social hub includes WhatsApp registration link. `https://www.jkyog.org/social-media` (previously fetched in this convo)
- **Online classes** explicitly ask users to “Join our WhatsApp group for timely reminders.”  
  Source: `https://www.jkyog.org/online-classes` (previously fetched)
- **Prem Yoga Community** uses a WhatsApp group join link. [PYC link page: `https://www.jkyog.org/PYCWhatsApp`] (previously fetched)

### 4.4 JKYog WhatsApp list design (category opt-in + program-specific)
To match WhatsApp best practice (“separate opt-in by category” [1]) and JKYog’s program structure, create **distinct opt-in streams** (separate links/QRs/forms):

**A) Daily Inspiration (global)**
- Audience: adults/seekers
- Purpose: retention, daily practice
- Note: This already exists (broadcast concept); main fix is surfacing it earlier in the journey.

**B) Online Class Reminders (by track)**
- Audience: people who registered / showed intent for Online Classes
- Purpose: attendance lift, routine building
- Use-case alignment: JKYog already positions WhatsApp as reminder channel for online classes.

**C) Events + Local Center Updates (by center/region)**
- Audience: people interested in a *specific* center/temple
- Purpose: satsang times, festival logistics, last-minute changes

**D) Parents Ops (Bal Mukund)**
- Audience: parents of kids **5–15** (program explicitly targets this range on RKT site)  
  Source: Bal Mukund age range: `https://www.radhakrishnatemple.net/balmukund` (previously fetched)

**E) Youth (13+) ops + content**
- Audience: Youth Club (explicitly **Ages 13+**)  
  Source: Youth Club page shows ages 13+: `https://www.jkyog.org/jkyog-youth-club` (previously fetched)

**F) YUVA (college + young professionals)**
- Audience: YUVA members (explicitly positioned for “university students and young professionals”)  
  Source: `https://www.jkyog.org/yuva` (previously fetched)

**G) Seva/Volunteer Ops**
- Audience: volunteers + coordinators
- Purpose: shift reminders, checklists, urgent changes (separate from donor comms)

**H) Donor/Impact Updates**
- Audience: donors who explicitly opt into impact updates
- Purpose: stewardship (impact proof), then campaign bursts

### 4.5 “Intent moment” surfacing plan (specific to JKYog’s pages/flows)
The biggest JKYog fix is *not* “more WhatsApp,” it’s placing the right WhatsApp opt-in at the right moments:

- **Online Classes page & registration flow**: after sign-up, present “Get reminders on WhatsApp” (already a stated promise on the page).  
  Source: `https://www.jkyog.org/online-classes` (WhatsApp reminders mention)
- **After someone joins a center/temple page**: “Get weekly satsang reminders for *this* location” (local list).  
  Source: centers exist: `https://www.jkyog.org/centers` (previously fetched)
- **Bal Mukund registration confirmation**: parent ops list (“schedule changes / what to bring / festival days”).
- **Youth Club registration**: youth list (session reminders + capstone/service ops).
- **YUVA membership registration**: YUVA list for “talk reminders + Q&A joining links.”
- **Post-event thank-you pages/emails**: “Join local updates” (keeps the relationship local).

### 4.6 WhatsApp copy standard (simple but compliant)
Keep the user-facing copy short, but include **category** + **opt-out**, because WhatsApp itself encourages category-based expectations. [1]

Example:
- “Get **JKYog Online Class reminders** on WhatsApp. Reply **STOP** to opt out.”

Internally store source + timestamp (audit trail) for quality control.

---

## 5) Email cadence recommendations (JKYog-specific segmentation + nonprofit benchmarks)

### 5.1 What email should do for JKYog (not duplicating WhatsApp)
- Email is the **explainer + router**: “what is LTP?”, “how to join a center?”, “how to keep a daily practice?”, “what’s the next step after my first event?”
- WhatsApp is for **short reminders + micro-practice prompts**. Email is for context + longform.

### 5.2 Verifiable frequency benchmarks (nonprofit context)
- Nonprofit frequency distribution (2011 report cited by Wired Impact): **Monthly 43%**, **Every other week 17%**, **Weekly 12%**, **Quarterly 16%**. [4]  
- Wired Impact also cites Mailchimp + HubSpot: “monthly-only” is associated with **78% higher unsubscribe rate** than **12/month**, and unsub rates drop when moving to **1–6 emails/month**. [4]

### 5.3 JKYog cadence (tied to journeys + within 1–6 emails/month where possible)
**A) General seekers newsletter (“Wisdom + What’s next”)**
- **2/month** default (fits within the “1–6/month” range). [4]
- Include 1 “wisdom takeaway” + 1 “next step” CTA (Online Class / local center / upcoming event)

**B) Online Classes digest**
- **Weekly max** (≈4/month; within 1–6/month). [4]
- Structure: upcoming schedule + 1 takeaway + recording link (if available) + WhatsApp reminders CTA (because the online classes page already primes this behavior)

**C) Parents (Bal Mukund)**
- **Weekly ops email** during term + “important dates” roll-up once/month.

**D) Youth Club + YUVA**
- **Weekly** if the program runs weekly; **biweekly** if calendar is lighter.

**E) Donors**
- **Monthly impact** + **quarterly campaign burst** (time-bound, specific outcome)
- Keep donor email separate from general seekers.

### 5.4 Stack-implementable email automation (what’s realistic)
- **GoHighLevel** can run trigger→action sequences with IF/Else and webhooks. [3]
- **Constant Contact** supports automated welcome series / automation features (use for onboarding + preference capture). [5]

---

## 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific pillars; limited and measurable)

### 6.1 Verifiable best practice: limit pillars
Sprout Social recommends **3–5 content pillars** at any one time to avoid message dilution. [6]

### 6.2 JKYog’s 5 pillars (mapped to the funnel + actual programs)
1) **Wisdom → Modern Life** (Swamiji teachings; “mind management” style content)
   - Goal: reach + saves/shares
   - Route: “Join Daily Inspiration WhatsApp” + “Try Online Classes”

2) **Practice Prompts** (micro-sadhana: 2-minute practices, guided reflection)
   - Goal: habit formation (MOFU)
   - Route: WhatsApp reminders/prompts

3) **Pathways (What to do next)** (very JKYog-specific)
   - Explain: LTP vs retreat vs satsang center vs Online Classes vs SMEx vs YUVA
   - Goal: reduce confusion; increase registrations

4) **Community + Seva**
   - Volunteer spotlights, community service, temple/center life
   - Goal: trust + volunteer conversion

5) **Youth & Family**
   - Bal Mukund (5–15), Youth Club (13+), YUVA (students/young professionals)
   - Goal: program enrollment + retention

### 6.3 Measurement method (make it operational)
Tag every post by pillar and review pillar performance monthly (Sprout recommends pillars to streamline planning and keep each post purposeful). [6]

---

## 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific; implementable via GHL + optional Podium)

### 7.1 Use-case priority (don’t overbuild)
Implement automations that directly increase:
- **attendance** (classes/events)
- **repeat attendance**
- **volunteer activation**
- **donor stewardship**

### 7.2 What GHL can verifiably support
GoHighLevel workflows are built as **Triggers → Actions**, can be chained, include IF/Else logic, and can use webhooks. [3]  
This is enough to implement the JKYog core workflows below.

### 7.3 JKYog workflows (specific to programs + journeys)

**Workflow A: New seeker welcome → choose path**
- Trigger: newsletter signup / form submitted
- Actions:
  - Email 1: “Start here” + pick interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Daily Inspiration / Youth & Family)
  - IF/Else: tag contact based on selection
  - Email 2: deliver best starter resource for their choice
  - Email 3: WhatsApp opt-in for the relevant category (classes reminders vs daily inspiration)

**Workflow B: Online class registration → attendance lift**
- Trigger: Online class registration form submit
- Actions:
  - Immediate confirmation email (link + schedule)
  - Reminder(s) (email; WhatsApp if opted-in)
  - Post-class recap email → next session link → join community prompt

**Workflow C: Event registration (LTP/retreat/festival) → show-up + next step**
- Trigger: event registration
- Actions:
  - confirmation + add-to-calendar
  - logistics message(s)
  - post-event: “What next?” (join center, join online class, join local WhatsApp list)

**Workflow D: Volunteer interest → active volunteer → coordinator**
- Trigger: volunteer interest form
- Actions:
  - onboarding email + role selection
  - shift scheduling prompts + checklist
  - after first shift: recognition + next responsibility step

**Workflow E: Donor stewardship**
- Trigger: donation recorded (via integration or form)
- Actions:
  - immediate thanks + impact statement
  - 7-day impact proof follow-up
  - monthly impact digest
  - quarterly campaign

### 7.4 Podium (if used): compliant opt-out handling
If JKYog uses Podium for SMS ops, Podium provides an API endpoint to opt out a contact (useful for suppression/compliance). [9] It also publishes guidance on segmentation/keywords (useful for list hygiene and opt-in capture). [7][8]

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (JKYog-specific)

**Purpose (mapped to JKYog journeys)**
- **New devotee → first event → recurring attendee**: reminders + logistics so people actually show up and return.  
- **Online consumer → donor → major donor**: value-first inspiration + occasional impact proof (no blasting).  
- **Volunteer → coordinator**: operations coordination (shifts, checklists), separate from marketing.

**Policy constraints (non‑negotiable)**
- You may only message users if they gave their number **and** gave **opt‑in permission**. [1]  
- WhatsApp recommends **separate opt‑in by message category** to reduce blocks. [1]  
- Automation is allowed during the **24‑hour window** and you must offer escalation paths (email/phone/web/in‑chat human handoff). [1]

**JKYog category lists (separate opt‑ins; separate links/QRs)**
- **Daily Inspiration (Adults/seekers)**: short daily value message (only for daily opt‑in).  
- **Online Class Reminders (Online learners)**: reminders tied to JKYog Online Classes (“timely reminders” is already promised). [2]  
- **Local Center/Temple Events (by city/center)**: satsang times, festivals, urgent logistics.  
- **Parents Ops (Bal Mukund; Kids 5–15)**: schedule changes, what to bring, key dates. [3]  
- **Youth Club (Ages 13+)**: session reminders + program opportunities. [4]  
- **YUVA (college students/young professionals)**: talk reminders + membership updates. [5]  
- **Volunteers Ops**: shift coordination only.  
- **Donor/Impact Updates**: impact-only + time-bound campaigns.

**Where to capture opt‑ins (JKYog intent moments)**
- **Online Classes**: after registration + on the classes page (it already asks users to join WhatsApp for reminders). [2]  
- **Centers/temples**: QR codes at entry/info desk/prasad line → “Get updates for this location.” [6]  
- **Program enrollments**: Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA confirmation pages → the matching list. [3][4][5]  
- **Post-event follow‑up**: “Want local updates + next satsang reminder? Join your center list.”

**Message rules (keep quality high)**
- **One message = one purpose** (reminder *or* inspiration *or* logistics).  
- **One link max**, keep messages short, and always allow opt‑out (e.g., “Reply STOP”).  
- Track list health using blocks/STOPs; if a list spikes, reduce frequency and tighten segmentation.

---

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (JKYog-specific)

**What email should do (vs WhatsApp)**
- Email = **context + routing** (“what to do next” after a class/event).  
- WhatsApp = **short reminders + micro-practices**.

**Benchmark (verifiable)**
- Monthly is common (43% of nonprofits), but Wired Impact cites data suggesting unsubscribe rates drop when moving from monthly-only to **1–6 emails/month**. [7]

**JKYog cadence (simple defaults)**
- **General seekers**: **2/month** (“Wisdom + Next step” + “What’s coming up”).  
- **Online Classes digest**: **weekly max** (schedule + takeaway + link).  
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: **weekly ops** during term + optional monthly roundup.  
- **Youth/YUVA**: **weekly or biweekly** depending on programming volume.  
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + **quarterly** time-bound campaign.

**Stack fit**
- GHL workflows support trigger→actions and branching for segmented cadences. [8]  
- Constant Contact supports automated welcome series/automation for onboarding + routing. [9]

---

### 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific)

**Keep pillars limited (verifiable)**
- Sprout recommends **3–5 content pillars** at a time. [10]

**JKYog’s 5 pillars (each should route to a next step)**
1) **Wisdom → modern life** (teachings; save/share content)  
2) **Practice prompts** (2-minute habits; “join WhatsApp daily inspiration”)  
3) **Pathways** (LTP vs retreat vs online classes vs centers vs SMEx vs YUVA)  
4) **Community + Seva** (volunteer stories + impact proof)  
5) **Youth & Family** (Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA)

**Operational rule**
- Tag every post by pillar and review monthly (keep what works, drop what doesn’t). [10]

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific, implementable)

**GHL capability (verifiable)**
- Workflows = **Triggers → Actions** with filters, IF/Else branching, chaining, and webhooks. [8]

**JKYog “minimum viable” automations (highest impact)**
1) **New subscriber → Start-here routing**
   - Trigger: signup/form  
   - Action: ask interest (classes/events/inspiration/youth/volunteer), tag, send the right next-step email.

2) **Online class registration → show-up + repeat attendance**
   - Trigger: class signup  
   - Action: confirmation → reminders → post-class recap → link to next session + community.

3) **Event registration → show-up + next step**
   - Trigger: event signup  
   - Action: confirmation → logistics → post-event thank-you → join local center list / online class.

4) **Volunteer interest → activation ladder**
   - Trigger: volunteer form  
   - Action: onboarding → first shift scheduling → post-shift recognition → next responsibility.

5) **Donor stewardship**
   - Trigger: donation captured  
   - Action: immediate thanks → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign.

**If Podium is used for SMS**
- Use segmentation/keywords for opt-in capture and the opt-out endpoint for compliance suppression. [11][12][13]

what are pillars, expand slightly more on it

Pillars (also called **content pillars**) are the **small set of repeatable content themes** you decide to post about consistently. They’re the “buckets” that keep your social content focused, balanced, and easy to plan—so you’re not reinventing ideas every week, and your audience knows what to expect.

### Why pillars matter (practical)
- **Consistency without boredom**: you rotate between a few themes instead of posting random topics.
- **Clear audience promise**: followers learn “JKYog posts wisdom + practices + community,” not just announcements.
- **Easier planning + delegation**: anyone on the team can create content if the pillar rules are clear.
- **Measurement**: you can see which themes drive saves/shares/registrations and adjust.

### How many pillars should you have?
A common best practice is **~3–5 pillars at a time**; more than that usually dilutes the message and makes planning messy. [1]

### Pillars vs formats (important difference)
- **Pillars = what you talk about** (themes)
- **Formats = how you say it** (Reels, Shorts, carousel, story, live)

Example: “Practice prompts” (pillar) can be a Reel, a Story, or a carousel.

### JKYog example pillars (and what goes inside each)
1) **Wisdom → modern life**
   - Short teachings tied to real problems (stress, focus, relationships)
2) **Practice prompts**
   - 1–2 minute daily sadhana actions (breath, reflection, mantra, gratitude)
3) **Pathways (what to do next)**
   - Clear explainers: Online Classes vs local center vs retreat/LTP vs SMEx vs YUVA
4) **Community + Seva**
   - Volunteer spotlights, behind-the-scenes, impact updates
5) **Youth & family**
   - Bal Mukund (kids 5–15), Youth Club (13+), YUVA (students/young professionals)

### Simple way to operationalize pillars
- Put every planned post into **one pillar** (no mixing).
- Track pillar performance monthly (saves/shares for Wisdom, registrations for Pathways, etc.).
- If a pillar isn’t performing after a few weeks, change the subtopics—not the whole strategy.

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (JKYog-specific; designed to work with GHL + WhatsApp Platform)

**Purpose**
- **Attendance lift**: get people from “interested” → “showed up” (Online Classes, retreats/LTP, local satsangs).  
- **Retention**: daily/weekly practice prompts so seekers stay consistent.  
- **Ops coordination**: volunteers + program teams (separate from marketing).

**Policy constraints (non‑negotiable)**
- You may only message users if they gave their number **and** gave **opt‑in permission**. [1]  
- WhatsApp recommends **separate opt‑in by message category** to reduce blocks. [1]  
- Automation is allowed when responding during the **24‑hour window**, and you must offer escalation paths (email/phone/web/in‑chat human handoff). [1]

**JKYog WhatsApp lists (separate opt‑ins; separate links/QRs)**
- **Daily Inspiration** (adults/seekers)  
- **Online Class Reminders** (online learners) — aligns with JKYog’s “join WhatsApp for reminders” positioning. [2]  
- **Local Center/Temple Updates** (by center/region) — satsang times, festivals, urgent logistics. [3]  
- **Parents Ops: Bal Mukund** (kids 5–15) [4]  
- **Youth Club** (ages 13+) [5]  
- **YUVA** (university students + young professionals) [6]  
- **Volunteers Ops** (shift checklists, urgent coordination)  
- **Donor/Impact Updates** (impact proof + time-bound campaigns)

**Where to capture opt‑ins (JKYog intent moments)**
- **Online Classes**: after signup + on the classes page (it already asks users to join WhatsApp for reminders). [2]  
- **Centers/temples**: QR at entry/info desk/prasad line → “Get updates for this location.” [3]  
- **Program enrollments**: Bal Mukund / Youth Club / YUVA confirmation pages → the matching list. [4][5][6]  
- **Post‑event follow‑up**: “Join your local updates list” (keeps relationship local).

**How this runs in GoHighLevel**
- Capture opt-ins via **GHL forms/surveys** → apply **tags** (e.g., `WA:Daily`, `WA:OnlineClasses`, `WA:RKT_Dallas`). [7]  
- Use **workflows** to route: when someone tags into `WA:OnlineClasses`, send the correct onboarding and reminders (via your WhatsApp provider/API). [7]  
- If you use WhatsApp Business Platform, use **templates** for business-initiated messages as needed. [8]

---

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (JKYog-specific; built for GHL automations)

**Benchmark (verifiable)**
- Wired Impact cites nonprofit frequencies and notes unsub rates drop when sending **1–6 emails/month** vs monthly-only. [9]

**JKYog cadence (simple defaults)**
- **General seekers**: **2/month** (“Wisdom + Next step” + “Upcoming events/classes”).  
- **Online Classes**: **weekly digest max** (schedule + 1 takeaway + link).  
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: **weekly ops** during term + monthly key dates roundup.  
- **Youth/YUVA**: **weekly or biweekly** depending on session frequency.  
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + **quarterly** time-bound campaign.

**How this runs in GoHighLevel**
- Use **form-submission triggers** to enter people into the right cadence (General vs Classes vs Youth vs Parents vs Donors). [7]  
- Use **IF/Else** to keep segments clean (e.g., if `tag = Donor`, exclude from general appeals). [7]  
- Use **re‑permission / suppression** automations for inactive subscribers (protects deliverability). [7]

---

### 6) Social content pillars (JKYog-specific; designed to feed GHL capture)

**What pillars are**
- Pillars are your **3–5 repeatable themes** that structure your entire content calendar. Sprout recommends **~3–5 pillars** at a time to avoid dilution. [10]

**JKYog’s 5 pillars (each with one “next step”)**
1) **Wisdom → modern life** → CTA: “Join Daily Inspiration WhatsApp”  
2) **Practice prompts** → CTA: “Get daily prompts/reminders on WhatsApp”  
3) **Pathways (what to do next)** → CTA: “Register for Online Classes / event”  
4) **Community + Seva** → CTA: “Volunteer interest form / donor impact updates”  
5) **Youth & Family** → CTA: “Enroll Bal Mukund / join Youth Club / join YUVA”

**How this runs with GHL**
- Every CTA goes to a **GHL form/landing page** so you can tag the contact by pillar/source (e.g., `SRC:IG`, `Pillar:Practice`). [7]  
- This makes social measurable beyond vanity metrics (you can attribute registrations/opt-ins).

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific; implementable in GHL)

**GHL capability (verifiable)**
- Workflows = **Triggers → Actions**, with filters, IF/Else branching, chaining, and webhooks. [7]

**JKYog “minimum viable” workflows (highest impact)**
1) **New subscriber → Start-here routing**
   - Trigger: email signup  
   - Actions: ask interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Inspiration / Youth & Family / Volunteer) → tag → send the right onboarding sequence. [7]

2) **Online class registration → attendance + repeat attendance**
   - Trigger: online class registration form  
   - Actions: confirmation → timed reminders → post-class recap → next session link → community invite. [7]

3) **Event registration (LTP/retreat/festival) → show-up + next step**
   - Trigger: event registration form  
   - Actions: confirmation + add-to-calendar → logistics → post-event thank-you → join local center updates list. [7]

4) **Volunteer interest → activation ladder**
   - Trigger: volunteer form  
   - Actions: onboarding → training/shifts → post-first-shift recognition → coordinator pathway. [7]

5) **Donor stewardship**
   - Trigger: donation captured (via payment integration/webhook)  
   - Actions: receipt/thanks → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign. [7]

**WhatsApp integration note**
- If JKYog uses WhatsApp Business Platform, use **template messages** for business-initiated messaging where required. [8]  
- Keep WhatsApp category opt-ins consistent with policy best practice. [1]

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (JKYog-specific: fix funnel + reduce drop-off)

**What WhatsApp should do for JKYog**
- **Attendance lift**: get people from “interested” → “showed up” for Online Classes, satsangs, retreats/LTP.
- **Retention**: lightweight daily/weekly spiritual prompts that keep seekers consistent.
- **Operations**: separate WhatsApp streams for volunteers/program ops (no marketing).

**Non‑negotiables (policy + quality)**
- You may only message users if they gave you their number **and** gave **opt‑in permission**. [1]
- WhatsApp explicitly recommends **separate opt‑in by message category** (this is the justification for multiple lists). [1]
- Automation is allowed during the **24‑hour window**, but you must provide escalation paths (email/phone/web/in‑chat human). [1]

**JKYog WhatsApp “lists” (category opt‑ins; separate join links/QRs)**
- **Daily Inspiration (Adults/seekers)**: value-only prompts; this already exists as a WhatsApp join flow on JKYog’s social hub—needs better placement. [2]
- **Online Class Reminders (Online learners)**: JKYog already tells users to join WhatsApp for reminders—formalize this into a dedicated opt-in. [3]
- **Local Center / Temple Updates (by location)**: “This week’s satsang + festival logistics” routed by the center directory. [4]
- **Parents Ops: Bal Mukund (Kids 5–15)**: ops-only reminders (schedule, what to bring). [5]
- **Youth Club (Ages 13+)**: session reminders + opportunities. [6]
- **YUVA (university students + young professionals)**: talk/Q&A reminders and membership updates. [7]
- **Volunteers Ops**: shift reminders/checklists.
- **Donor/Impact Updates**: impact proof + time-bound campaigns only.

**Where to surface WhatsApp (JKYog intent moments)**
- **Online Classes**: after registration + on the classes page (it already promises WhatsApp reminders). [3]
- **Centers**: QR codes and links at temple entry/info desk/prasad line → “Get updates for this location.” [4]
- **Program enrollments**: Bal Mukund / Youth Club / YUVA confirmation → matching list. [5][6][7]
- **Post-event follow-up**: “Join local updates” (keeps the relationship local and reduces future drop-off).

**Implementation assumption (migration-ready)**
- If migrating to **WhatsApp Business Platform**, use **template messages** when required for business-initiated messaging. [8]
- Keep category opt-ins consistent with policy best practice. [1]

---

### 5) Email cadence recommendations (JKYog-specific: segment-first, predictable, non-spammy)

**What email should do**
- Email is the **anchor + router**: explain “what to do next” (join a center, attend next satsang, start Online Classes, enroll kids/youth, join YUVA, volunteer).
- WhatsApp does **reminders**; email does **context and longer-form guidance**.

**Benchmarks (verifiable)**
- Wired Impact cites nonprofit frequency norms and notes unsubscribe rates drop when moving to **1–6 emails/month** vs monthly-only. [9]

**JKYog recommended “products” + cadence**
- **General seekers newsletter**: **2/month**
  - Issue A: wisdom + 1 story + 1 next step
  - Issue B: upcoming classes/events (split by region if possible)
- **Online Classes digest**: **weekly max** (schedule + 1 takeaway + link). [3]
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: **weekly ops during term** + monthly key-dates roundup. [5]
- **Youth Club + YUVA**: **weekly or biweekly** depending on schedule. [6][7]
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + **quarterly time-bound campaign** (separate from general list).

**One rule that improves channel communications immediately**
- Every email footer includes “Update preferences” (topics + frequency + region + WhatsApp vs email), so the audience controls volume.

---

### 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific: pillars that route to the right next step)

**What pillars are**
- Pillars = the **3–5 repeatable themes** that structure all social content so it stays consistent and measurable. Sprout recommends keeping this to **~3–5 pillars**. [10]

**JKYog’s 5 pillars (each with a single primary CTA)**
1) **Wisdom → modern life** (teachings + practical application)  
   - CTA: Join **Daily Inspiration** WhatsApp or Online Classes
2) **Practice prompts** (2-minute habits, guided reflection)  
   - CTA: Get **WhatsApp prompts/reminders**
3) **Pathways (“What should I do next?”)**  
   - Explain: Online Classes vs local center vs retreat/LTP vs youth/kids vs community  
   - CTA: register/join the *one* relevant next step
4) **Community + Seva** (volunteer stories, behind-the-scenes, impact proof)  
   - CTA: volunteer interest / donor impact updates
5) **Youth & Family** (Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA)  
   - CTA: enroll / register / join youth list

**JKYog-specific operational note**
- Tag every post by pillar and review monthly; keep what drives registrations/attendance and reduce low-signal posts. [10]

---

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific: build around real programs)

**What to automate (priority = attendance + repeat engagement)**
GoHighLevel workflows are built as **Triggers → Actions** and support branching (filters/IF-Else) and webhooks. [11] Use that to automate only what improves communications across the three journeys.

**Minimum viable workflows (highest impact for JKYog communications)**

1) **New subscriber → “Start here” routing (email-first, WhatsApp optional)**
- Trigger: newsletter signup / form submit
- Actions: ask interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Daily Inspiration / Youth & Family / Volunteer) → tag → send the right onboarding sequence → offer the matching WhatsApp list.

2) **Online Class registration → show-up + repeat attendance**
- Trigger: Online Class registration
- Actions: confirmation → reminders → post-class recap → link to next session → invite to JKYog Community (discussion layer). [12][3]

3) **Event registration (retreat/LTP/festival) → show-up + next step**
- Trigger: event registration
- Actions: confirmation + add-to-calendar → logistics → post-event thank-you → “next step” routing (center + Online Classes + WhatsApp local list).

4) **Volunteer interest → activation ladder**
- Trigger: volunteer form
- Actions: onboarding → role assignment → first shift reminders → post-shift recognition → coordinator pathway.

5) **Donor stewardship**
- Trigger: donation captured (via integration/webhook)
- Actions: immediate thank-you → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign.

**WhatsApp automation note**
- If you adopt WhatsApp Business Platform for automation at scale, use template messages where required. [8]

### A tighter, non-repetitive pillar system for JKYog (less “themes,” more “jobs-to-be-done”)

You’re right: the earlier pillars overlapped (wisdom vs practice vs pathways). A better JKYog set is built around **distinct user intents** that match your journeys and programs. Keep it to **3–5 pillars** (Sprout’s guidance) so it stays operational. [10]

#### JKYog Social Pillars v2 (5 pillars, clearly separated)

| Pillar | Audience intent (what they want right now) | What content belongs here (rules) | 3 concrete examples | Primary CTA (pick 1) | Primary KPI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1) Start Here (Onboarding & Navigation)** | “I’m new—where do I begin?” | Explain *basics + next step* in plain language. No deep scripture. Always answer: **What is this? Who is it for? What do I do next?** | “New to JKYog? Start with this 7‑day plan.” / “Online class vs satsang vs retreat—what’s the difference?” / “Find your nearest center in 30 seconds.” | `Online Classes` page [2] **or** `Centers` page [6] | Link clicks → registrations / center visits |
| **2) One Teaching, One Takeaway (Swamiji clip + application)** | “Give me one insight I can use today.” | 15–60s clip or quote with **one** practical takeaway. No multi-topic carousels. | “How to handle anger in 10 seconds (1 practice).” / “What ‘surrender’ means in daily life.” / “1 line from Gita + 1 action.” | Full talk / podcast / blog OR subscribe | Saves + shares (value signal) |
| **3) Do It With Me (Guided practice)** | “Help me practice, not just learn.” | Guided **micro-practice**: pranayam, meditation prompt, mantra, 2-minute reflection. Avoid long explanations; “follow along.” | “2‑minute guided calm-down.” / “1 breath technique before sleep.” / “Weekly ‘practice challenge’ prompt.” | Join **WhatsApp reminders** (class/practice) [2] | Completion + repeat participation (views, replies) |
| **4) Community Proof (Centers, festivals, Seva, impact)** | “Show me real people + real community.” | Local moments + behind-the-scenes + volunteer stories + impact proof. This is where trust is built for donors/volunteers. | “A day at satsang (Dallas/center).” / “Volunteer spotlight: what seva looks like.” / “Event highlights + what’s next.” | Volunteer interest / attend local event / donor impact updates | Volunteer signups + event RSVPs |
| **5) Youth & Family Tracks (segmented programs)** | “I’m a parent / teen / young adult—what’s for me?” | Only youth-family content: Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA. Keep it age-appropriate, privacy-first. | “Bal Mukund: what kids learn (ages 5–15).” [5] / “Youth Club: leadership pillars (13+).” [6] / “YUVA: talk + Q&A for students/young pros.” [7] | Register/enroll for the relevant program | Registrations + inquiries |

**Why this is less repetitive**
- “Wisdom” and “Practice” are separated by **format + intent**: Pillar 2 = insight; Pillar 3 = follow-along practice.
- “Pathways” is not a vague pillar anymore—it's explicitly the **Start Here** onboarding/navigation pillar.
- “Community + Seva” is a proof pillar (trust + belonging), not a generic feel-good bucket.
- Youth/Family is isolated so it doesn’t dilute adult seekers’ feed.

---

### How to use this without it turning into “vibes”
- **Every post must fit exactly one pillar** (if it doesn’t, rewrite it).
- **Each pillar has one primary CTA** (don’t mix “join WhatsApp + donate + register” in the same post).
- **Weekly planning**: decide your weekly output by pillar (example: 2× Pillar 2, 1× Pillar 3, 1× Pillar 1, 1× Pillar 4; rotate Pillar 5 as needed).
- **Measurement**: tag posts by pillar and review monthly—keep pillars, but adjust subtopics based on what converts. (Sprout recommends pillar discipline and keeping pillars limited.) [10]

**User**

no, search online for the pillars of religious foundations, or what jkyogs actual pillars are

---

**Cursor**

I’ll look up (1) JKYog’s own stated “pillars” and (2) commonly used pillars/frameworks for religious/faith-based foundations, then summarize what’s credible and directly applicable.

JKYog **does** publish its “pillars” explicitly—and they’re not the same as the generic “pillars” you’ll find for other religious foundations.

## JKYog’s actual pillars (official)
On JKYog’s official “About” page, they define **three organizational pillars** (their “modus operandi”): **Wisdom, Sadhana, Seva**. [1]

- **Wisdom**: Application of theoretical knowledge  
- **Sadhana**: Practice devotion to connect with God  
- **Seva**: Express love for God through service [1]

JKYog also frames an **advanced-seeker practice framework** as “five essential principles” of Divine Love:
- **Shradha (Faith), Satsang (Congregation), Sadhana (Practice), Seva (Service), Sharanagati (Surrender)** [1]  
These are not presented as the main “JKYog pillars” header, but they function like a second, more spiritual/practice-level pillar set for deeper audiences.

## Common “pillars” frameworks used by religious foundations (examples)
Different faith orgs define pillars differently. Two credible examples:

- **Acts 2 / early Christian community pillars** (often used as a ministry framework):  
  **Teaching (didache)**, **Worship/prayer (liturgia)**, **Fellowship (koinonia)**, **Service (diakonia)**, **Proclamation/witness (kerygma/marturia)**. [2]

- **PC(USA) Matthew 25 “Three Core Pillars”** (mission pillars):  
  **Eradicating systemic poverty**, **dismantling structural racism**, **building congregational vitality**. [3]

## What to use for your JKYog channel strategy
For this project, if the goal is “JKYog wants to improve its channel communications,” you should treat **JKYog’s own pillars (Wisdom/Sadhana/Seva)** as the “brand truth,” and then make your channel content pillars *express* them:
- Wisdom → teaching/explainer content
- Sadhana → practice/rem

I’ll pull JKYog’s official statements of pillars/programs and a few current best-practice references on content pillars for social, then I’ll produce a JKYog-specific “Social content buckets” section with concrete buckets, examples, CTAs, and measurement—cited.

### 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific; built from JKYog’s *actual* pillars + programs)

#### 6.1 Start from JKYog’s real pillars (brand truth → content system)
JKYog explicitly defines its organizational pillars as **Wisdom, Sadhana, Seva**. [1]  
Your social “buckets” should be an **operational translation** of these pillars into repeatable content series that route people into JKYog’s real next steps (Online Classes, WhatsApp inspiration, Centers, Youth tracks, Community, etc.). [1][2][3][7]

#### 6.2 JKYog Social Bucket Framework (8 buckets under 3 pillars)
Each bucket has a **single job**, a **single primary CTA**, and a **single destination**.

| Bucket (Series Name) | JKYog Pillar | Audience | Content promise (what they get) | Formats (IG/YT) | Primary CTA → Destination | What it should drive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **W1: “One Teaching, One Takeaway”** | Wisdom | New + general seekers | 1 teaching → 1 practical application (no multi-topic posts) | YT Shorts, IG Reels, carousel | “Join Online Classes” → `Online Classes` [3] | Saves/shares + class registrations |
| **W2: “Scripture Made Simple (Series)”** | Wisdom | New seekers + parents/youth | “What is X?” (Gita, bhakti, surrender) explained plainly in 60–120s | Reels/Shorts, explainer carousels | “Start with this class” → `Online Classes` [3] | Reduced confusion + click-through |
| **W3: “Ask Swamiji / Doubt Clarifier”** | Wisdom | Intermediate seekers | Q&A clips; remove friction (“how do I…?”) | Shorts + weekly longform clip | “Go deeper” → `Community` discussion thread [7] | Comments + community sign-ins |
| **S1: “2-Minute Sadhana (Follow-along)”** | Sadhana | Busy adults | Follow-along micro-practice (breath/meditation/reflection) | Reels/Shorts + Stories | “Get daily inspiration” → WhatsApp Inspiration broadcast [2] | WhatsApp opt-ins + repeats |
| **S2: “Class-to-Practice Bridge”** | Sadhana | Online class attendees | 1 key class concept + “try this today” (bridges learning → habit) | Post-class Reel/Short + Story | “Get reminders” → Online Classes WhatsApp reminders [3] | Attendance lift + repeat attendance |
| **Se1: “Seva in Action (Impact Proof)”** | Seva | Donors + volunteers + trust-building | Show service with receipts: what was done + who benefited | Short doc clips, photo essays | “Volunteer” → Volunteer form (linked from About page) [1] | Volunteer leads + donor intent |
| **YF1: “Bal Mukund at Home”** | Wisdom + Sadhana | Parents (kids/youth) | What kids learn + 1 simple at-home practice | Parent-friendly reels, slides | “Register” → Bal-Mukund registration [4] | Parent inquiries + enrollment |
| **YF2: “Youth Track (13+) & YUVA Track (18–30)”** | Wisdom + Seva | Teens + young adults | Leadership, human excellence, service mindset, career exploration (youth) + YUVA talks/book club/Gita study | Shorts, student clips, event promos | “Join/register” → Youth Club [5] or YUVA membership [6] | Registrations + retention |

**Why this is not repetitive:** the buckets are separated by **job-to-be-done** (teach vs explain vs Q&A vs follow-along practice vs class reinforcement vs impact proof vs parents vs youth/young adults), even when they share the same pillar.

#### 6.3 JKYog-specific “sub-buckets” for youth programs (use what JKYog already states)
The Youth Club page itself defines “**4 Pillars for Holistic Development**”:  
**Leadership & Communication, Human Excellence, Service Mindset, Career Exploration**. [5]  
Use those as **sub-buckets** inside `YF2` so youth content isn’t generic.

#### 6.4 Bucket-to-channel fit (practical publishing rules)
- **Instagram / YouTube Shorts**: primary engines for **W1, W2, S1** (high-frequency, high-reach).
- **YouTube longform**: weekly anchor that gets repurposed into **W1/W3/S2** clips.
- **Stories**: reminders + “join WhatsApp” + “register now” (but keep CTAs to one per story sequence).
- **Community platform**: use as the “discussion + retention layer” for **W3** (Q&A follow-ups) and post-class threads. [7]
- **Social hub**: explicitly shows JKYog runs multiple sub-brands (Bal-Mukund, Youth Club, etc.), so buckets map cleanly to those lines. [2]

#### 6.5 Measurement (bucket KPIs, not vanity)
- **Wisdom buckets (W1–W3)**: saves/shares, link clicks to Online Classes, community sign-ins. [3][7]
- **Sadhana buckets (S1–S2)**: WhatsApp opt-ins + class attendance (Online Classes page explicitly supports WhatsApp reminders + attendance tracking). [3]
- **Seva bucket (Se1)**: volunteer lead submissions + donor conversion (separate from general audience).
- **Youth/Family buckets (YF1–YF2)**: program registrations (Bal Mukund / Youth Club / YUVA). [4][5][6]

### 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific)

#### 6.1 Anchor buckets to JKYog’s real pillars
JKYog’s official pillars are **Wisdom, Sadhana, Seva**. Your social buckets should be a practical translation of these into repeatable series that route people into JKYog’s real next steps (Online Classes, WhatsApp, Centers, Youth programs, Community). [1][2][3][7]

#### 6.2 Buckets (8 total, under the 3 pillars)
Each bucket has **one job** and **one primary CTA**.

**Wisdom (learn)**
1) **One Teaching → One Takeaway**: 15–60s clip + 1 actionable insight.  
   - CTA: `Online Classes` [3]
2) **Scripture Made Simple**: “What is X?” explainers (Gita/bhakti/surrender) in plain language.  
   - CTA: `Online Classes` [3]
3) **Doubt Clarifier (Q&A)**: common questions answered; end with “discuss here.”  
   - CTA: `JKYog Community` [7]

**Sadhana (practice)**
4) **2‑Minute Sadhana (Follow‑along)**: breath/meditation/reflection you can do now.  
   - CTA: WhatsApp Inspiration broadcast [2]
5) **Class → Practice Bridge**: 1 class takeaway + “do this today” prompt.  
   - CTA: Online Classes WhatsApp reminders [3]

**Seva (serve)**
6) **Seva in Action (Impact Proof)**: volunteer stories + concrete outcomes (what happened / who benefited).  
   - CTA: Volunteer signup (linked from About page) [1]

**Youth & Family (segmented tracks)**
7) **Bal Mukund at Home**: what kids learn + 1 simple at‑home practice for parents.  
   - CTA: `BalMukund-Online` registration [4]
8) **Youth Track + YUVA Track**:  
   - Youth (13+): leadership/excellence/service/career (matches Youth Club’s program pillars). [5]  
   - YUVA: talks/book club/Gita study for students & young professionals. [6]  
   - CTA: `Youth Club` [5] or `YUVA membership` [6] (pick one per post)

#### 6.3 Operating rules (keeps comms clean)
- **One post = one bucket + one CTA** (no mixed asks).  
- Tag posts by bucket and review monthly; double down on buckets that drive registrations/opt-ins. (General pillar best practice: keep pillars limited and measurable.) [8]

okay, make it clear and concise.

### 4) WhatsApp broadcast strategy (JKYog-specific: fix funnel + reduce drop-off)
 
**What WhatsApp should do for JKYog**
- **Attendance lift**: get people from “interested” → “showed up” for Online Classes, satsangs, retreats/LTP.
- **Retention**: lightweight daily/weekly spiritual prompts that keep seekers consistent.
- **Operations**: separate WhatsApp streams for volunteers/program ops (no marketing).
 
**Non‑negotiables (policy + quality)**
- You may only message users if they gave you their number **and** gave **opt‑in permission**. [1]
- WhatsApp explicitly recommends **separate opt‑in by message category** (this is the justification for multiple lists). [1]
- Automation is allowed during the **24‑hour window**, but you must provide escalation paths (email/phone/web/in‑chat human). [1]
 
**JKYog WhatsApp “lists” (category opt‑ins; separate join links/QRs)**
- **Daily Inspiration (Adults/seekers)**: value-only prompts; this already exists as a WhatsApp join flow on JKYog’s social hub—needs better placement. [2]
- **Online Class Reminders (Online learners)**: JKYog already tells users to join WhatsApp for reminders—formalize this into a dedicated opt-in. [3]
- **Local Center / Temple Updates (by location)**: “This week’s satsang + festival logistics” routed by the center directory. [4]
- **Parents Ops: Bal Mukund (Kids 5–15)**: ops-only reminders (schedule, what to bring). [5]
- **Youth Club (Ages 13+)**: session reminders + opportunities. [6]
- **YUVA (university students + young professionals)**: talk/Q&A reminders and membership updates. [7]
- **Volunteers Ops**: shift reminders/checklists.
- **Donor/Impact Updates**: impact proof + time-bound campaigns only.
 
**Where to surface WhatsApp (JKYog intent moments)**
- **Online Classes**: after registration + on the classes page (it already promises WhatsApp reminders). [3]
- **Centers**: QR codes and links at temple entry/info desk/prasad line → “Get updates for this location.” [4]
- **Program enrollments**: Bal Mukund / Youth Club / YUVA confirmation → matching list. [5][6][7]
- **Post-event follow-up**: “Join local updates” (keeps the relationship local and reduces future drop-off).
 
**Implementation assumption (migration-ready)**
- If migrating to **WhatsApp Business Platform**, use **template messages** when required for business-initiated messaging. [8]
- Keep category opt-ins consistent with policy best practice. [1]
 
---
 
### 5) Email cadence recommendations (JKYog-specific: segment-first, predictable, non-spammy)
 
**What email should do**
- Email is the **anchor + router**: explain “what to do next” (join a center, attend next satsang, start Online Classes, enroll kids/youth, join YUVA, volunteer).
- WhatsApp does **reminders**; email does **context and longer-form guidance**.
 
**Benchmarks (verifiable)**
- Wired Impact cites nonprofit frequency norms and notes unsubscribe rates drop when moving to **1–6 emails/month** vs monthly-only. [9]
 
**JKYog recommended “products” + cadence**
- **General seekers newsletter**: **2/month**
  - Issue A: wisdom + 1 story + 1 next step
  - Issue B: upcoming classes/events (split by region if possible)
- **Online Classes digest**: **weekly max** (schedule + 1 takeaway + link). [3]
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: **weekly ops during term** + monthly key-dates roundup. [5]
- **Youth Club + YUVA**: **weekly or biweekly** depending on schedule. [6][7]
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + **quarterly time-bound campaign** (separate from general list).
 
**One rule that improves channel communications immediately**
- Every email footer includes “Update preferences” (topics + frequency + region + WhatsApp vs email), so the audience controls volume.
 
---
 
### 6) Social content buckets (JKYog-specific: pillars that route to the right next step)
 
**What pillars are**
- Pillars = the **3–5 repeatable themes** that structure all social content so it stays consistent and measurable. Sprout recommends keeping this to **~3–5 pillars**. [10]
 
**JKYog’s 5 pillars (each with a single primary CTA)**
1) **Wisdom → modern life** (teachings + practical application)  
   - CTA: Join **Daily Inspiration** WhatsApp or Online Classes
2) **Practice prompts** (2-minute habits, guided reflection)  
   - CTA: Get **WhatsApp prompts/reminders**
3) **Pathways (“What should I do next?”)**  
   - Explain: Online Classes vs local center vs retreat/LTP vs youth/kids vs community  
   - CTA: register/join the *one* relevant next step
4) **Community + Seva** (volunteer stories, behind-the-scenes, impact proof)  
   - CTA: volunteer interest / donor impact updates
5) **Youth & Family** (Bal Mukund, Youth Club, YUVA)  
   - CTA: enroll / register / join youth list
 
**JKYog-specific operational note**
- Tag every post by pillar and review monthly; keep what drives registrations/attendance and reduce low-signal posts. [10]
 
---
 
### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific: build around real programs)
 
**What to automate (priority = attendance + repeat engagement)**
GoHighLevel workflows are built as **Triggers → Actions** and support branching (filters/IF-Else) and webhooks. [11] Use that to automate only what improves communications across the three journeys.
 
**Minimum viable workflows (highest impact for JKYog communications)**
 
1) **New subscriber → “Start here” routing (email-first, WhatsApp optional)**
- Trigger: newsletter signup / form submit
- Actions: ask interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Daily Inspiration / Youth & Family / Volunteer) → tag → send the right onboarding sequence → offer the matching WhatsApp list.
 
2) **Online Class registration → show-up + repeat attendance**
- Trigger: Online Class registration
- Actions: confirmation → reminders → post-class recap → link to next session → invite to JKYog Community (discussion layer). [12][3]
 
3) **Event registration (retreat/LTP/festival) → show-up + next step**
- Trigger: event registration
- Actions: confirmation + add-to-calendar → logistics → post-event thank-you → “next step” routing (center + Online Classes + WhatsApp local list).
 
4) **Volunteer interest → activation ladder**
- Trigger: volunteer form
- Actions: onboarding → role assignment → first shift reminders → post-shift recognition → coordinator pathway.
 
5) **Donor stewardship**
- Trigger: donation captured (via integration/webhook)
- Actions: immediate thank-you → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign.
 
**WhatsApp automation note**
- If you adopt WhatsApp Business Platform for automation at scale, use template messages where required. [8]

- Email is the **anchor + router**: explain “what to do next” (center, satsang, Online Classes, youth/kids, YUVA, volunteer).
- WhatsApp does **reminders**; email does **context + longer-form guidance**.

**Benchmarks (verifiable)**
- Unsubscribe rates drop when moving to **1–6 emails/month** vs monthly-only. [9]

**JKYog recommended “products” + cadence**
- **General seekers newsletter**: **2/month**
  - Issue A: wisdom + 1 story + 1 next step
  - Issue B: upcoming classes/events (split by region if possible)
- **Online Classes digest**: **weekly max** (schedule + 1 takeaway + link). [3]
- **Parents (Bal Mukund)**: **weekly ops during term** + monthly key-dates roundup. [5]
- **Youth Club + YUVA**: **weekly or biweekly** depending on schedule. [6][7]
- **Donors**: **monthly impact** + **quarterly** campaign (separate list).

**One rule that improves channel communications immediately**
- Every email footer includes “Update preferences” (topics + frequency + region + WhatsApp vs email).

### 6) Social content buckets (platform‑native + funnel‑aligned for JKYog)  **(REPLACEMENT)**

**Principle**
- Keep **3–5 pillars** (repeatable buckets) so planning stays consistent and measurable. [10]

**JKYog pillars (use JKYog’s own language)**
JKYog’s organizational pillars are **Wisdom, Sadhana, Seva**. Social buckets should express these and route to real next steps (Online Classes, WhatsApp, Centers, Youth programs, Community). [2][3][4][12]

**Buckets (5) — each has one job + one primary CTA**
1) **Wisdom: One Teaching → One Takeaway**  
   - **Platforms**: IG Reels, YT Shorts, FB Reels, LinkedIn short video  
   - **Format examples**: 30–60s clip; quote + 1 question; “myth vs truth” mini-clip  
   - **Funnel role**: Awareness → Engagement  
   - **CTA**: `Online Classes` [3]

2) **Sadhana: Try This Today (micro‑practice)**  
   - **Platforms**: IG Stories/Reels, FB Stories/Reels, YT Shorts, LinkedIn posts  
   - **Format examples**: 2‑minute follow-along breath/meditation; “comment DONE” prompt; weekly 7‑day practice challenge  
   - **Funnel role**: Engagement → Habit → Participation  
   - **CTA**: WhatsApp Inspiration or WhatsApp class reminders (pick one per post) [2][3]

3) **Pathways: What should I do next? (navigation content)**  
   - **Platforms**: IG carousels, FB posts/events, YT Community, LinkedIn updates  
   - **Format examples**: “Start here” carousel; “Online Class vs local center vs retreat/LTP” explainer; “How to join in 3 steps” screen-record  
   - **Funnel role**: Engagement → Participation  
   - **CTA**: `Centers` (local) **or** `Online Classes` (virtual) — choose one [4][3]

4) **Seva: Impact + Trust (proof, not hype)**  
   - **Platforms**: FB + LinkedIn (case-study style), IG/FB Reels, YT mini-doc  
   - **Format examples**: “Impact in one story” (30–90s); volunteer spotlight; progress update post  
   - **Funnel role**: Participation → Donation/Volunteer → Retention  
   - **CTA**: Volunteer or donor updates (pick one per post) [1]

5) **Youth & Family: Segmented program content**  
   - **Platforms**: IG/FB (parents), YT Shorts (youth), LinkedIn (YUVA/professional angle)  
   - **Format examples**: Bal Mukund class peek; Youth Club skills/pillars; YUVA talk + student Q&A promo  
   - **Funnel role**: Participation → Enrollment → Retention  
   - **CTA**: `Youth Club` **or** `YUVA` **or** `Bal Mukund` (one per post) [6][7][5]

**Operating rule**
- Each post must map to **one bucket** and carry **one CTA**; tag posts by bucket and review monthly. [10]

### 7) Automation triggers and workflows (JKYog-specific: build around real programs)

**What to automate (priority = attendance + repeat engagement)**
GoHighLevel workflows are built as **Triggers → Actions** and support branching (filters/IF-Else) and webhooks. [11] Automate only what improves communications across the journeys.

**Minimum viable workflows (highest impact for JKYog communications)**

1) **New subscriber → “Start here” routing (email-first, WhatsApp optional)**
- Trigger: newsletter signup / form submit
- Actions: ask interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Daily Inspiration / Youth & Family / Volunteer) → tag → onboarding sequence → matching WhatsApp list.

2) **Online Class registration → show-up + repeat attendance**
- Trigger: Online Class registration
- Actions: confirmation → reminders → post-class recap → next session link → invite to JKYog Community. [12][3]

3) **Event registration (retreat/LTP/festival) → show-up + next step**
- Trigger: event registration
- Actions: confirmation + add-to-calendar → logistics → post-event thank-you → next-step routing (center + Online Classes + WhatsApp local list).

4) **Volunteer interest → activation ladder**
- Trigger: volunteer form
- Actions: onboarding → role assignment → first shift reminders → post-shift recognition → coordinator pathway.

5) **Donor stewardship**
- Trigger: donation captured (via integration/webhook)
- Actions: immediate thank-you → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign.

**WhatsApp automation note**
- If you adopt WhatsApp Business Platform for automation at scale, use template messages where required. [8]
