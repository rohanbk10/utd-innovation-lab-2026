Design a comprehensive channel strategy for JKYog.

## Which Channels Serve Which Journeys



### New Devotee: Help with routing

The current layout of the website is centered around Swamiji and not necessarily a clear navigation flow for local members wanting to visit the temple.

**Best Channel:**

“New to JKYog?” button on the landing page of the website.

High priority, medium effort

Simpler navigation to “Events” & “More about JKYog”

High priority, low effort

---

### Donor Journey: Clear navigation to donation

Making sure “Donate” links are always clear and on top with an easily navigable donation page.

Sending updates on donations via WhatsApp messages and keeping donors in the loop.

Consistent “Thank you” messages along with “Your Impact” videos and texts.

**Best Channel:**

Making the “Donate” button prominent and visible on the website.

High priority, low effort.

Automated “Thank you” messages and Impact snippets.

High priority, medium effort.

1 on 1 communication with major donors via WhatsApp messages.

Targeted high, priority medium effort.

---

### Volunteer Journey: Where to send volunteers

Creating clear navigation paths for folks wanting to volunteer.

Unclear need for volunteers and unclear description of roles.

There is currently a lack of in person signup opportunities during events.

**Best Channel:**

Add a “Serve/Volunteer” button on the website.

High priority, medium effort.

QR codes on site that lead to Volunteer chats on WhatsApp.

High priority, low effort.

Event/role specific channels and communications on WhatsApp.

High priority, low effort.

---

Volunteers: Event based communication and available volunteer opportunities.

**Email guidelines:**

Strong and focused subject lines.

Use names when possible.

Highlight the impact of the community as opposed to the organizational needs.

Every email should add value, and not feel like a newsletter blast.

---

### WhatsApp

**Purpose:** High trust, high open rate communication.

**Tone:** Gratitude, NEVER guilt driven, personable, digestable.

**General Guidelines:**

## WhatsApp Broadcast Strategy (JKYog-Specific: Fix Funnel + Reduce Drop-Off)



### What WhatsApp Should Do for JKYog

Attendance lift: move people from “interested” → “showed up” for Online Classes, satsangs, retreats/LTP.

Retention: daily/weekly spiritual prompts that build consistency.

Operations: separate WhatsApp streams for volunteers/program ops (no marketing).

---

### Nonnegotiables (Policy + Quality)

You may only message users if they gave you their number and gave optin permission. [1]

WhatsApp recommends separate optin by message category (reason for multiple lists). [1]

Automation is allowed during the 24hour window, but you must provide escalation paths (email/phone/web/inchat human). [1]

---

### JKYog WhatsApp “Lists” (Category Optins; Separate Join Links/QRs)

Daily Inspiration (Adults/seekers): value-only prompts; already exists—needs better placement. [2]

Online Class Reminders (Online learners): formalize into a dedicated opt-in (already promised on classes page). [3]

Local Center / Temple Updates (by location): satsang + festival logistics, routed by center. [4]

Parents Ops: Bal Mukund (Kids 5–15): ops-only reminders (schedule, what to bring). [5]

Youth Club (Ages 13+): session reminders + opportunities. [6]

YUVA (university students + young professionals): talk/Q&A reminders + membership updates. [7]

Volunteers Ops: shift reminders/checklists.

Donor/Impact Updates: impact proof + time-bound campaigns only.

---

### Where to Surface WhatsApp (JKYog Intent Moments)

Online Classes: after registration + on the classes page. [3]

Centers: QR codes/links at temple entry/info desk/prasad line. [4]

Program enrollments: Bal Mukund / Youth Club / YUVA confirmations. [5][6][7]

Post-event follow-up: “Join local updates” to reduce future drop-off.

---

### Implementation Assumption (Migration-Ready)

If migrating to WhatsApp Business Platform, use template messages where required. [8]

Keep category opt-ins consistent with policy best practice. [1]

---

## Email Cadence Recommendations (Segment-First, Predictable, Non-Spammy)



### What Email Should Do

Email is the anchor + router: explain “what to do next” (center, satsang, Online Classes, youth/kids, YUVA, volunteer).

WhatsApp does reminders; email does context + longer-form guidance.

---

### Benchmarks (Verifiable)

Unsubscribe rates drop when moving to 1–6 emails/month vs monthly-only. [9]

---

### JKYog Recommended “Products” + Cadence

General seekers newsletter: 2/month

Issue A: wisdom + 1 story + 1 next step

Issue B: upcoming classes/events (split by region if possible)

Online Classes digest: weekly max (schedule + 1 takeaway + link). [3]

Parents (Bal Mukund): weekly ops during term + monthly key-dates roundup. [5]

Youth Club + YUVA: weekly or biweekly depending on schedule. [6][7]

Donors: monthly impact + quarterly campaign (separate list).

---

### One Rule That Improves Channel Communications Immediately

Every email footer includes “Update preferences” (topics + frequency + region + WhatsApp vs email).

---

## Social Content Buckets (Platform-Native + Funnel-Aligned for JKYog)



### Principle

Keep 3–5 pillars (repeatable buckets) so planning stays consistent and measurable. [10]

JKYog’s organizational pillars are Wisdom, Sadhana, Seva. Social buckets should express these and route to real next steps (Online Classes, WhatsApp, Centers, Youth programs, Community). [2][3][4][12]

---

### Buckets (5) — Each Has One Job + One Primary CTA

#### 1) Wisdom: One Teaching → One Takeaway

Platforms: IG Reels, YT Shorts, FB Reels, LinkedIn short video

Format examples: 30–60s clip; quote + 1 question; “myth vs truth” mini-clip

Funnel role: Awareness → Engagement

CTA: Online Classes [3]

---

#### 2) Sadhana: Try This Today (Micropractice)

Platforms: IG Stories/Reels, FB Stories/Reels, YT Shorts, LinkedIn posts

Format examples: 2minute follow-along breath/meditation; “comment DONE” prompt; weekly 7day practice challenge

Funnel role: Engagement → Habit → Participation

CTA: WhatsApp Inspiration or WhatsApp class reminders (pick one per post) [2][3]

---

#### 3) Pathways: What Should I Do Next? (Navigation Content)

Platforms: IG carousels, FB posts/events, YT Community, LinkedIn updates

Format examples: “Start here” carousel; “Online Class vs local center vs retreat/LTP” explainer; “How to join in 3 steps” screen-record

Funnel role: Engagement → Participation

CTA: Centers (local) or Online Classes (virtual) — choose one [4][3]

---

#### 4) Seva: Impact + Trust (Proof, Not Hype)

Platforms: FB + LinkedIn (case-study style), IG/FB Reels, YT mini-doc

Format examples: “Impact in one story” (30–90s); volunteer spotlight; progress update post

Funnel role: Participation → Donation/Volunteer → Retention

CTA: Volunteer or donor updates (pick one per post) [1]

---

#### 5) Youth & Family: Segmented Program Content

Platforms: IG/FB (parents), YT Shorts (youth), LinkedIn (YUVA/professional angle)

Format examples: Bal Mukund class peek; Youth Club skills/pillars; YUVA talk + student Q&A promo

Funnel role: Participation → Enrollment → Retention

CTA: Youth Club or YUVA or Bal Mukund (one per post) [6][7][5]

---

### Operating Rule

Each post must map to one bucket and carry one CTA; tag posts by bucket and review monthly. [10]

---

## Automation Triggers and Workflows (Build Around Real Programs)



### What to Automate (Priority = Attendance + Repeat Engagement)

GoHighLevel workflows are built as Triggers → Actions and support branching (filters/IF-Else) and webhooks. [11] Automate only what improves communications across the journeys.

---

### Minimum Viable Workflows (Highest Impact for JKYog Communications)

#### 1) New Subscriber → “Start Here” Routing (Email-First, WhatsApp Optional)

Trigger: newsletter signup / form submit

Actions: ask interest (Online Classes / Local Center / Events / Daily Inspiration / Youth & Family / Volunteer) → tag → onboarding sequence → matching WhatsApp list.

---

#### 2) Online Class Registration → Show-Up + Repeat Attendance

Trigger: Online Class registration

Actions: confirmation → reminders → post-class recap → next session link → invite to JKYog Community. [12][3]

---

#### 3) Event Registration (Retreat/LTP/Festival) → Show-Up + Next Step

Trigger: event registration

Actions: confirmation + add-to-calendar → logistics → post-event thank-you → next-step routing (center + Online Classes + WhatsApp local list).

---

#### 4) Volunteer Interest → Activation Ladder

Trigger: volunteer form

Actions: onboarding → role assignment → first shift reminders → post-shift recognition → coordinator pathway.

---

#### 5) Donor Stewardship

Trigger: donation captured (via integration/webhook)

Actions: immediate thank-you → 7-day impact proof → monthly impact digest → quarterly campaign.

---

### WhatsApp Automation Note

If you adopt WhatsApp Business Platform for automation at scale, use template messages where required. [8]
