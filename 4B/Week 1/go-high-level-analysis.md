*(JKYog Evaluation Document)*

---

# Executive Summary (JKYog Context)

**Best “all-in-one benchmark”: GoHighLevel (GHL)**  
Strongest combined stack for funnels + CRM + automations + multi-account scaling + API access, with transparent base pricing and usage-based communications.

**Best “marketing-suite alternative”: Freshworks Freshmarketer**  
Strong WhatsApp + SMS/MMS marketing + automated journeys + landing pages + attribution, but operates on a marketing-contacts model and is less agency/sub-account oriented.

**Current tool: Podium**  
Strongest for inbox/phones/reviews/payments + AI lead conversion. Pricing is quote-based and it is less of a funnel-first marketing operating system.

## Recommended Path: Adopt GHL as Marketing System of Record

Use GHL for:  
- Event funnels  
- Donation journeys  
- Volunteer pipelines  
- Cross-channel automation  
- Multi-brand scaling (Confer / Odyssey)  

Keep Podium temporarily if:  
- Phones/inbox workflows are deeply embedded

Freshmarketer is the best structured alternative if:  
- WhatsApp journeys are a major priority  
- Marketing-contact ceilings are manageable

# Final Recommendation

JKYog should transition its marketing engine to GoHighLevel in phases:

Phase 1: Build funnels + journeys in GHL  
Phase 2: Run parallel with Podium  
Phase 3: Sunset Podium modules as ROI is validated  

HighLevel offers the strongest long-term scalability, API flexibility, and multi-account structure for expansion initiatives.
